<h2><span class="pagenum"><a id="pagev" name="pagev"></a>(p. v)</span> PREFACE.</h2>

<p>Of the period of which this book treats, there have been political
histories, and scurrilous books written anent the Royal Family, <i lang="la">ad
nauseam</i>: and the Diaries which have been published, bearing on this
time, deal only with the acts, and sayings, of the higher
classes&mdash;leaving the life of the vastly greater proportion of the
population&mdash;the middle classes&mdash;untouched. No better source of
information as to their mode of living, their amusements, the tattle,
and passing follies of the times, can possibly be found, than in the
Newspapers of the day; and I selected the commencement of the <cite>Times</cite>,
1 Jan. 1788, as the starting point of a picture of the Social Life at
the end of the Eighteenth Century.</p>

<p>The copies of the <cite>Times</cite>, however, are very imperfect,&mdash;nay, in some
years, totally missing&mdash;until 1793-1794&mdash;from which date they are
perfect; so that, when anything noteworthy occurred, I have drawn from
another source; and, to establish the undoubted authenticity of each
quotation, I have given the title of the Newspaper, with its date.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="pagevi" name="pagevi"></a>(p. vi)</span> The daily Newspapers of those times were totally different to
those to which we are accustomed. The absence of Railways, Steamships,
and Electric Telegraphs, combined with a very high rate of Postage,
prevented the publication of all News, either from foreign or
provincial sources, except it were of real importance; and, as the
daily sheets must be filled, it followed, as a matter of course, that
a substitute was found in detailing the social life of the
Metropolis&mdash;and the daily Newspapers, which now give us the latest
news from all parts of the globe&mdash;had to be filled with social
paragraphs, anecdotal, satirical, or otherwise. They were as open to
correction, or contradiction, then, as now; so that we may put trust
in them; and when these paragraphs are collected, and somewhat
classified, they afford a view of the daily life of the period, such
as is utterly unattainable elsewhere. This collection must, of
necessity, be valuable to the student of those times, besides being of
great interest to the general reader.</p>

<p>The difficulty of obtaining contemporary illustrations, fitted for
this work, from books, or pictures, has compelled me to draw freely on
the satirical prints of the period&mdash;which are abundant, and perfectly
well suited to the purpose, if the reader will only bear in mind, that
they are sometimes a little exaggerated. Still, on the whole, they so
truthfully represent the manners, costume, &amp;c., of the age, that they
could not be omitted; and that they are faithful reproductions of the
originals, I can guarantee, for I drew them all myself.</p>

<h2>OLD TIMES.</h2>

<p>Although this book does not pretend to be a history of the times of
which it treats, still, it will materially help the reader, if, at the
outset, some of the principal events which occurred during the period
are succinctly narrated.</p>

<p>We start with the year 1788&mdash;and one of the first items of importance
is the founding of the colony of New South Wales; for Captain
Phillips, on 28th January, landed the first batch of convicts,
consisting of 561 men, 192 women, and 18 children, also a military
force of 212 men. As soon as they were all on shore, Phillips ordered
the King's Commission to be read, and assumed the office of Governor.
Such was the modest foundation of our great Australian Empire. On the
same day at home, Lord George Gordon, of Protestant rioting memory,
was brought before the judges of the King's Bench, to receive sentence
on two libels, one against the Queen of France, and another on the
criminal justice of the country. His sentence for the former, was
three years' imprisonment, for the latter, two years, to pay a <span class="pagenum"><a id="page2" name="page2"></a>(p. 2)</span>
fine of £500, and find security for his good behaviour for fourteen
years. He fled to Holland, was arrested, brought back, and lodged in
Newgate. He did not live to regain his liberty, but death set him free
1st November 1793.</p>

<p>An all-absorbing topic of conversation in this year was the trial of
Warren Hastings, for his conduct whilst Governor-General of Bengal.
The trial commenced on the 13th of February, and it took place in
Westminster Hall, which was fitted up with a throne and canopy, having
the woolsack for the Lord Chancellor in front. On either side the
throne was a private box, one for the use of the King, the other for
the Queen: the King never used either throne or box, but, when he went
to the trial, he went <i lang="la">incognito</i>.</p>

<p>There were seats covered with green baize for the accommodation of
members of the House of Commons, but all the rest of the hall was
glowing with red baize. Boxes were also provided for the Ambassadors
and <i lang="fr">Corps Diplomatique</i>. The grand show commenced at eleven <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> with
the entrance of the committee appointed to manage the impeachment, all
of them in full dress, followed by Burke, who headed the members of
the House of Commons.</p>

<p>Hardly had they taken their seats when a buzz of excitement filled the
hall, for no one less than the Queen, attended by all her daughters,
entered. She did not go to the royal box, but sat in part of the Duke
of Newcastle's Gallery. This attracted the attention of all, until the
coming in of the peers, including the judges, and the Bishops, the
string of Dukes being closed by the Prince of Wales (as Duke of
Cornwall), and the Dukes of York, Gloucester, and Cumberland. Lord
Thurlow, the Lord Chancellor, came last. The peers all wore their
robes and collars, the robes of the royal <span class="pagenum"><a id="page3" name="page3"></a>(p. 3)</span> dukes being borne by
pages. Then the Chancellor's mace-bearer cried "Oyez, Oyez, Oyez," and
notified to all, that Warren Hastings had come to take his trial, and
that his accusers might come forth and make good their charges against
him. The Lord Chancellor addressed the prisoner, and told him to be
prepared with his defence, to which Hastings replied, "My Lords, I am
come to this high tribunal equally impressed with a confidence in my
own integrity and in the justice of the court before which I stand."
As this trial will not again be mentioned, I may state the fact, that
it lasted seven years and three months, and ended in his acquittal,
17th April 1795.</p>

<p>Another remarkable event happened in this year, for on 31st January
there died at Rome, at the age of sixty-seven, the young Pretender,
Prince Charles Edward Louis Casimir Stuart, grandson of James II.;
and, with him, died all hope for the Jacobite party, for he left
behind him but one natural daughter, on whom he conferred the empty
title of Duchess of Albany. It is true that he left his pretensions to
the throne of England to his brother, Cardinal York, but all this
Prince did to claim regal honours was to strike a medal, on which he
styled himself Henry the IXth. He knew there was no use in continuing
the struggle, so accepted a pension from George III., which was paid
him until his death.</p>

<p>There is little worth chronicling until we come to the (to Englishmen)
most painful event of the year, namely, the King's illness. In July
his physicians remarked symptoms in him which gave them grave concern,
but he visited Cheltenham, and improved in his health. In October,
however, rumours began to get about that all was not well. The
<cite>Morning Post</cite> of 30th October <span class="pagenum"><a id="page4" name="page4"></a>(p. 4)</span> mentions that "On 28th His
Majesty complained of a pain in his bowels, and by the advice of his
physicians, and the rest of His Majesty's attendants, he is not
expected to leave Windsor for the course of a week or a fortnight."
Next day we hear that "the chief symptom is said to be a swelling in
the legs." Then news is brought, that on the 4th November he had a
relapse; on the 7th he is reported better, though, as a matter of
fact, he was delirious at dinner on the 5th. On the 9th they say he is
better; on the 10th he is <span class="smcap">MUCH BETTER</span>, and <span class="smcap">HOPES ARE ENTERTAINED OF
HIS RECOVERY</span>. The bulletins of the 11th are vague; that of the 12th
reports that he "was not better," and the newspapers of the 13th
openly speak of a Regency. In the <cite>Morning Post</cite> of November 14th it
plainly states that "his mental faculties were more deranged." Then
his physicians quarrelled amongst themselves as to his treatment, and
wrote daily contradictory bulletins, until Dr. Willis took his patient
under his sole charge, with good effect. And so ends 1788.</p>

<p class="p2">1789 opens with a great frost, one of the heaviest on record. It
commenced on the 24th November 1788, and continued, with one
intermission (from December 24th to December 26th) until 13th January
1789. On 10th January the Thames at Irongate&mdash;which is below London
Bridge, by the Tower, was frozen over, and several booths were erected
on the ice. The day previously an ox was roasted whole, and eagerly
bought by the people who were skating and sliding. The <cite>Annual
Register</cite> thus describes the sight:&mdash;"The scene on the Thames is very
entertaining; from Putney Bridge upwards, the river is completely
frozen over, and people walk to and from the different villages on the
face of the deep. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page5" name="page5"></a>(p. 5)</span> Opposite to Windsor Street booths have been
erected since Friday last, and a fair is kept on the river. Multitudes
of people are continually passing and repassing; puppet shows,
roundabouts, and all the various amusements of Bartholomew Fair are
exhibited. In short, Putney and Fulham, from the morning dawn till the
dusk of returning evening, is a scene of festivity and gaiety. On the
12th a young bear was baited on the ice, opposite to Redriffe
(Rotherhithe), which drew multitudes, and fortunately no accident
happened to interrupt their sport." The outward-bound vessels at
Deptford and Gravesend cleared out with all despatch, lest they should
be caught in the ice and detained or damaged.</p>

<p>The usual royal gift of £1000 to the poor of London was this year not
forthcoming, so the Prince of Wales ordered that sum to be given from
his own treasury. He also sent large sums to the poor of Edinburgh
and Brighton.</p>

<p>A Bill to make the Prince of Wales Regent had been introduced in both
Houses of Parliament at the latter end of 1788, but was negatived in
each; in the Commons by 251 to 178. There had been great squabbling
over this Bill, especially between the rival leaders, Fox and Pitt;
the former asserting that the Prince of Wales had an <em>absolute right</em>
to succeed to the Regency, and the latter would only admit that he had
an <em>irresistible claim</em>.</p>

<p>But the King did not get better, and something must be done, yet it
was not thought fit to invest the Prince of Wales with altogether
regal powers: there must be some limitation. Therefore Pitt wrote to
His Royal Highness, detailing the plan intended to be pursued, which
was, that the Queen should have the care of the King's person, and the
disposition of the royal household, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page6" name="page6"></a>(p. 6)</span> by which means she would
enjoy the patronage of 400 places, amongst which were the offices of
Lord Steward, Lord Chamberlain, and Master of the Horse: but the
Prince should have no power of granting any office, reversion, or
pension, for any other term than during the King's pleasure, nor might
he confer any peerage.</p>

<p>This, no doubt, was prudent, but was extremely distasteful to the
Prince, who wrote a dignified remonstrance to Pitt, at the end of
which, however, he consented to accept the terms, being convinced of
the evils which might arise were there no Regency. Fifty-five peers,
together with the Dukes of York and Cumberland, signed a protest
against the limitations, but the Commons cared but little for it. They
went on with their work, and, on the 12th February, sent up the Bill
to their Lordships for consideration; and they were debating it when
the proverb of "There's many a slip 'twixt the cup and the lip" was
fulfilled. On the 19th February the Lord Chancellor announced to the
House that the physicians reported that the King was rapidly
recovering from his malady. On this the House adjourned, and
practically no work was done, either by Lords or Commons, for three
weeks.</p>

<p>On 27th February the prayer for his recovery was discontinued, and, in
its stead, a form of prayer, and thanksgiving for his restoration to
health, was ordered to be read in all churches and chapels throughout
England and Wales. So completely had he recovered, that he ordered
Parliament to be opened by Commission, which was done on 10th March.
The 23rd April was appointed for a general thanksgiving, and his
Majesty, accompanied by the Queen and the Royal Family, went <span class="pagenum"><a id="page7" name="page7"></a>(p. 7)</span> in
solemn state to Saint Paul's, to render thanks to the Almighty for His
great mercy.</p>

<p>The following account is much condensed from the report in the
<cite>Morning Post</cite> of 24th April 1789:&mdash;"They started early, for,
precisely at eight o'clock in the morning, the first carriage that led
the procession reached St. Clement's Church in the Strand. After the
usual state pioneers, came the members of the House of Commons,
followed by the peers according to their several degrees, then the
Archbishops, and the princes of the blood royal, after whom came the
Prince of Wales, whose equipage outshone all others. Their Majesties'
Household came next, and lastly their Majesties themselves.</p>

<p>"The Queen seemed inexpressibly happy: the loud huzzas, which from
every quarter rent the air, testified to her, that <em>he</em> who was
dearest to her was dearest to the people.</p>

<p>"The King, as if impressed by the weight of the obligation which he
owed to Heaven for his recovery, and full of the religious solemnity
with which he was going, <em>publicly</em>, to acknowledge that obligation to
the Almighty, seemed to be unusually grave and silent; and behaved, at
this first appearance in public since his recovery, in a manner which
filled the spectators with reverence and awe.</p>

<p>"His Majesty appeared to be much reduced in point of size, but he
looked as if in perfect health."</p>

<p>It was a quarter-past three when the procession, on its return,
reached Temple Bar, and it was noted that the King looked more
cheerful, whilst the Queen was in high spirits.</p>

<p>London was, of course, brilliantly illuminated at night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page8" name="page8"></a>(p. 8)</span> This is the principal event of the year, and with it we will
close 1789.</p>

<p class="p2">As far as England, and its social economy, is concerned, 1790 is very
barren. In France, there was the commencement of that dreadful
revolution which terrorised all Europe, yet strangely enough all
allusion to France was omitted in the Royal Speeches to Parliament,
either on 21st January or 26th November.</p>

<p>The navy sadly wanted manning, so much so that a proclamation was
issued for encouraging seamen, and landsmen, to enter themselves on
board His Majesty's ships of war; that officers on foreign stations
should join their respective corps, and recalling, and prohibiting
seamen from serving foreign princes, and states. This was all very
well, for the fleet was in urgent need of men, owing to the number of
ships being put in commission, and ordered to be got ready for sea
with the greatest expedition: for instance&mdash;</p>

<ul>
  <li>At Deptford, 3;</li>
  <li>" <span class="add05em">Woolwich, 3;</span></li>
  <li>" <span class="add05em">Chatham, 3;</span></li>
  <li>" <span class="add05em">Sheerness, 3;</span></li>
  <li>" <span class="add05em">Portsmouth, 10 (one 100, and another 98 guns);</span></li>
  <li>" <span class="add05em">Plymouth, 7 (one 100 another 80 guns);</span></li>
</ul>

<p class="noindent">besides others which were expected to be commissioned in a few days.</p>

<p>Ordinary means were not sufficient to provide men, and resort was made
to impressment, a mode of obtaining seamen which is of ancient
practice. In 1378 a statute of 2 Richard II. speaks of it as being
well known, and so it must have been, for the first commission for its
use was issued 29 Edward III., 1355. In <span class="pagenum"><a id="page9" name="page9"></a>(p. 9)</span> 1641, Parliament
declared the practice illegal, either for the land or sea service; but
this has always been ignored when the necessity for seamen arose. It
has been regulated by Parliament even so lately as 1835, when, by the
statute 5 and 6 William IV., compulsory service is restricted to five
years.</p>

<p>How should we feel if some day, in reading our morning paper, we
should come across such a passage as the following:&mdash;"A very hot press
took place in the river Thames, and at all the outports"?&mdash;Would you
like to know what a "hot press" means?&mdash;then learn from the following
excerpts from the <cite>St. James's Chronicle</cite>, May 4-6, 1790:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The report of the number pressed in the river on Tuesday night was
delivered to the Lords of the Admiralty yesterday morning, which
amounted to about 1500 taken in Wapping, and in Southwark, &amp;c., more
than 600; amounting in the whole to upwards of 2100 men, besides those
at the different seaport towns, reports of which were not received."</p>

<p>"Four tenders went down the river yesterday morning, crowded with
impressed men, to be shipped on board a vessel of war lying in
Long-reach, ready to receive them. The same tenders were expected up
again with the return of the tide, upon the same errand."</p>

<p><i>Extract of a letter from Chatham, May 5.</i>&mdash;"Yesterday morning,
between six and seven o'clock, an express arrived from the Lords of
the Admiralty to Commodore Pasley, at this port, containing impress
warrants: accordingly, a great press commenced about twelve o'clock
last night, both in this town, Rochester, &amp;c. &amp;c., and on the river
Medway, when many persons were taken, four of whom were lodged in the
guardhouse in the yard, and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page10" name="page10"></a>(p. 10)</span> this morning sent on board the
'Scipio,' of 64 guns, lying as guardship at this port, and commanded
by Commodore Pasley. A great press likewise commenced last night at
Sheerness."</p>

<p>"In consequence of the press warrants, stocks felt a most
extraordinary depression yesterday; the Consols opened at 76, and
fluctuated from that price to 75-1/4 until very nearly three o'clock."</p>

<p>This then, was a "hot press"&mdash;but very little was ever said about it,
except a passing notice. The impressed men themselves accepted their
fate as inevitable, and, according to the testimony of an old seaman
whom I once knew (himself a pressed man), he assured me that, after
the first shock was over, they set to work with a will, and did their
duty as well as the volunteers. There were supposed to be exceptions,
such as apprentices, who were exempt, but I fear, when once in the
hands of the pressgang, it was a very poor chance of any one's getting
off.</p>

<p>A social note worthy of being recorded, in this year, was that a man
named John Frith, lieutenant of the second battalion of Royals, threw
a stone at His Majesty's coach. He seems to have done no harm, and was
evidently a lunatic, for no one in their senses would have endeavoured
to injure a king who was just then in the zenith of his popularity.
That he was insane the jury thought, for, on his trial for high
treason on 21st May, he was acquitted as being of unsound mind, but he
was put under safe watch and ward in Newgate, and only liberated on
11th December 1791, on bail being given to take proper care of him.</p>

<p class="p2">The year 1791 is remarkable for its uneventfulness, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page11" name="page11"></a>(p. 11)</span> nothing of
national importance occurring during the twelve-month. Impressment
still went on, as we see by the <cite>St. James's Chronicle</cite>, April
16-19.&mdash;"Friday night the press in the Thames, and on both sides the
river, was the warmest that has been at all since press warrants were
last issued. No fewer than eleven gallies were rowing about between
London Bridge and Deptford. Every one of His Majesty's frigates and
sloops on Channel service, as well as those in the North Sea and on
the Irish coast, have received orders to proceed upon the impress
service. The smaller vessels, as soon as they have procured forty
seamen each, are to deliver them over to the receiving ships at
Spithead and the Nore."</p>

<p>In 1787 a society was formed in England having for its object the
suppression of slavery, under the auspices of Granville Sharpe,
Clarkson, and others, and Mr. Wilberforce (by whose untiring efforts
its downfall was at last obtained) joined it. On the 18th April 1791,
the House of Commons resolved itself into a committee "to consider of
the African slave trade." Wilberforce made an eloquent speech, in
which he depicted the horrors of the trade. Among other barbarities he
mentioned the whipping, and holding red-hot coals, to the mouths of
those (in order to compel them to eat) who were desirous of putting an
end to their existence, by starving themselves to death; and, to prove
the preference given by those unhappy creatures of death to slavery,
he quoted part of the evidence, which told how they took every
opportunity of leaping overboard, and that, in the agonies of death,
when drowning, they would hold up their hands for joy in having
escaped from their tormentors.</p>

<p>He mentioned many cruelties which had passed unpunished, and
particularly one, which was committed <span class="pagenum"><a id="page12" name="page12"></a>(p. 12)</span> by a master upon his
female slave, a girl about six years old, by cutting her mouth from
ear to ear; he showed how injurious the slave trade was to our
mercantile navy, quoting from the muster rolls of Liverpool and
Bristol, that in one year, out of 12,263 seamen employed in the slave
trade, 2643 had died.</p>

<p>After many other arguments, he concluded with a motion, "That the
Chairman be directed to move for leave to bring in a Bill for
preventing the further importation of African negroes into the British
colonies and plantations."</p>

<p>The debate was continued, and adjourned until the next day&mdash;when the
battle <em>pro</em> slavery or its abolition waxed fierce; but when it came
to a decision, the numbers were&mdash;for the motion, 88; against,
163&mdash;majority against the abolition, 75.</p>

<p class="p2">1792 opened, as we would fain have our financial years open
now-a-days, with an increase of revenue over the preceding year of
£300,000, and a surplus of more than £900,000, besides paying the
annual million in reduction of the national debt. Pitt repealed
£200,000 of burdensome taxes, added £400,000 to the million to
extinguish the debt, and discreetly kept the balance in hand for
eventualities. Trade had vastly increased, as we may see from the
following figures:&mdash;In 1783 the exports were valued at £14,741,000;
and, in 1791, they had risen to £20,120,000.</p>

<p>On 2nd April, the House of Commons being in Committee, Mr. Wilberforce
again brought forward the question of the slave trade, and, after an
eloquent speech, wound up with the motion:&mdash;"That it is the opinion of
the Committee, that the trade carried on by <span class="pagenum"><a id="page13" name="page13"></a>(p. 13)</span> British subjects,
for the purpose of procuring slaves from Africa, ought to be
abolished." After a debate, Mr. Secretary Dundas moved as an
amendment, to insert the word "<em>gradually</em>" immediately before the
word "abolished."</p>

<p>This was carried by a majority of 68, and the motion, so altered,
being put, the numbers were&mdash;Ayes, 230; Noes, 85&mdash;majority for the
motion, 145. The Chairman was then ordered to move the House for leave
to bring in a Bill, pursuant to the said resolution.</p>

<p>England could not but be affected by the French Revolution. At the
commencement of the movement there was some sympathy shown by the
Whigs to a people who were struggling to free themselves from the
trammels of despotism, but that sympathy rapidly grew cold, and faded,
on witnessing the excesses committed by the people of Paris, and some
other large cities, until the capture, and imprisonment of the Royal
family, turned it to absolute loathing, and hatred.</p>

<p>There was great uneasiness throughout the country as to whether the
tide of anarchy might not reach us, especially as numbers of fugitives
were daily reaching our shores. Take, for example, two instances
quoted in the <cite>Annual Register</cite>, both of the date 12th September:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Southampton.</i>&mdash;One Ayland, a fisherman of Hamble, a village about
seven miles from Southampton, was fishing for lobsters on the coast of
France on Thursday last, and had taken in about half his cargo, when
he espied two boats full of men, seemingly in great distress; on which
he bore down, and received them on board. They had swam to their boats
to get away from the coast, and many of them were much bruised and
pelted with stones by others on shore. They begged the fisherman to
land them somewhere in <span class="pagenum"><a id="page14" name="page14"></a>(p. 14)</span> England, to prevent their being
murdered; which he promised to do, and offered them subsistence till
he had completed his lading. They represented the danger of being
intercepted, if he did not immediately proceed to sea, and offered him
any sum he should ask, to land them as soon as possible. He waived his
own interest, set sail, and landed them at the above village; but with
a spirit of humanity, which does honour to human nature, he absolutely
refused any reward whatever, although he had not completed his
fishing, which is the maintenance of his family."</p>

<p>"<i>Lewes.</i>&mdash;Upwards of 500 unfortunate emigrants were, last week,
landed on our coast, who have had the fury of the elements to contend
with, after escaping that of their countrymen. The Brighton packets,
heavily laden with them, were driven by the winds far eastward off
their usual track, and with difficulty made Hastings, Pevensey, and
Eastbourne. At the former place, on Wednesday morning, 76, all
ecclesiastics, came on shore, among whom were the Bishop of
Auvranches, the Dean of Rouen, and several other dignitaries. The
Bishop with great difficulty escaped from Auvranches by the assistance
of one of his grand vicars, who, with domestics, accompanied him to
Rouen, where they were for some days concealed. The populace having
again discovered them, they were again obliged to travel on foot, in
disguise, to Dieppe. They arrived in the night, took refuge a few
hours in an hotel; and, at the time appointed for the departure of the
packet, ran to the sea side, and, it providentially being high water,
were enabled to get out of reach of the rabble, who, in one minute
after, pursued them to the shore."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page15" name="page15"></a>(p. 15)</span> Take again an extract or two from the <cite>St. James's Chronicle</cite>
of 11-13th September 1792. "Between daybreak and eight o'clock
yesterday morning, thirteen broad-wheeled waggons, crowded with
<em>French emigrants</em>, passed through the Borough. During the night, and
the whole of yesterday forenoon, waggons, carts, and chaises, and
carriages of almost every other description, continued arriving in
town with emigrants, by way of Westminster, Blackfriars, and London
Bridges."</p>

<p>"It is a known fact, that upwards of <em>forty thousand French</em> men,
women, and children, are at this moment in England: two-thirds of them
of the lowest class, who, taking advantage of the convulsed state of
their native country, come over under the plausible title of <em>exiled
aristocrats</em>."</p>

<p>"There are three powerful reasons why the very great number of
arrivals here from France should excite the immediate attention of
Government. One, that it may occasion a rapid rise in the price of
provisions, already at a height that occasions much complaint among
the lower orders of people. Second, lest under the appellation of
fugitives, a multitude of insidious and evil-designing persons should
intrude themselves, with the intention of raising similar disturbances
in this kingdom. Third, lest it should be the means of introducing a
great number of rascals, thieves, and villains, who are always
cowards, and cannot have principle enough to take any side; these,
therefore, are the first to run. An inundation of them, added to the
bad among our own people, might not only render private property very
precarious, but even prove dangerous to the state."</p>

<p>The Government was fully alive to this great influx of Frenchmen, and
the possible effect it might have on <span class="pagenum"><a id="page16" name="page16"></a>(p. 16)</span> the people of England; so
they introduced, and passed, the "Act for establishing Regulations
respecting Aliens arriving in this kingdom, or resident therein, in
certain cases," 33 Geo. III. cap. 4. After the preamble, the gist of
which has been given, this Act enacts that all masters of vessels are
to give to the officer of the Custom, at the port of arrival, a
written declaration specifying the names, &amp;c., of foreigners on board.
All aliens arriving after 10th January 1793 were to give to the port
officer of the Customs a written declaration of their names, rank, &amp;c.
If they failed in so doing, they were to depart out of the realm, or
be transported for life. The officer of Customs had to furnish them
with a certificate, and, if they wished to change their abode, they
were to have a passport, which they were to show, or be committed for
trial. They must also depart from the realm when ordered by His
Majesty's proclamation, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>This was a somewhat severe ordinance, but as far as I know, it was
never acted on, for the French <em lang="fr">emigrés</em> were a quiet, law-abiding
people, thankful for the refuge they had received. It was during the
debate on this Bill that Burke made his historical <em lang="fr">coup de theatre</em>,
the dagger scene in the House of Commons. I quote from the <cite>St.
James's Chronicle</cite> 27-29th December 1792:&mdash;Burke <i lang="la">loquitur</i>. "It had
been declared by a noble Lord (Granville) in another place, that there
were known to be <em>nineteen assassins</em> in this country with daggers
for the extirpation of kings&mdash;but it had been said that nineteen were
of no consequence; he thought differently, for there were in that
number seven more than necessary to destroy the whole Royal family;
the number to him was alarming, for he knew not how many apprentices
those murderers <span class="pagenum"><a id="page17" name="page17"></a>(p. 17)</span> might have, nor how many encouragers in this
country; the knowledge of nineteen French murderers having arrived,
was a full justification of the present Bill. He thanked His Majesty's
Ministers for having brought it forward; it might prevent the arrival
of nineteen times nineteen of those monsters, and it might counteract
the intentions of that Englishman who had ordered the manufacture of
5000 daggers at Birmingham&mdash;how many for exportation, or how many for
home consumption, he knew not. He had, however, strong reasons to
believe that they were intended to introduce <em>French fraternity</em> into
the bosoms of Englishmen&mdash;to introduce murder and desolation, for
'<em>there! there!</em>' exclaimed Mr. Burke, <em>throwing a dagger upon the
floor of the House</em>, 'is the <em>fraternity of freedom</em>; that is the
fraternity they wish to plunge into the heart of our Sovereign; into
the heart of every virtuous Englishman who was loyal to his King, or
worshipped his God,'" &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>This rodomontade was only provocative of mirth, and it is said that
Sheridan asked&mdash;"You have thrown down the knife&mdash;where is the fork?"
which convulsed the House with laughter.</p>

<p class="p2">1793 opened gloomily with the trial, sentence, and decapitation of
Louis XVI. (sentenced 17th January, beheaded 21st January); and our
national sympathy towards the martyred King was shown by an order for
a general mourning, which it was hoped would be universal. "As our
Court has ordered an etiquette mourning for Louis XVI., there can be
little doubt that the people will, as one man, clothe themselves in a
garb expressive of their detestation of his murtherers."</p>

<p>Our relations with France had been very strained, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page18" name="page18"></a>(p. 18)</span> for some
time past, and war had long been expected. In December 1792 a
proclamation had been issued, embodying and calling out the militia.
Vessels were being hurriedly equipped, and commissioned, and nobody
was surprised, when, on 1st February, Parliament received a message
from the King, informing his people that M. Chauvelin had left this
country, and that there was an urgent necessity for augmenting the sea
and land forces. The number of French in England became a source of
uneasiness, and an Order of Council was issued on 2nd February,
directing all aliens, save such as were excepted by the Alien Act, to
reside within fifty miles of the standard on Cornhill, and ten miles
from the sea coasts, and dockyards.</p>

<p>The French had already begun hostilities, by laying an embargo on all
British shipping in French ports, and, on 5th February, we retaliated
by acting in the same manner; but the terms were not equal, for there
were but six, or eight, French vessels in our ports, whilst it was
reckoned that the French had got hold of over 1000 of our seamen. But
sailors were forthcoming to man the fleet, for we read, under 7th
February, that "Upwards of 2000 sailors entered the Royal Navy last
week."</p>

<p>On 11th February, the King sent the following message to Parliament:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">George R.</span>&mdash;His Majesty thinks proper to acquaint the House of
Commons, that the Assembly now exercising the powers of Government in
France have, without previous notice, directed acts of hostility to
be committed against the persons and property of His Majesty's
subjects, in breach of the law of nations, and of the most positive
stipulations of treaty, and have since, on the most groundless <span class="pagenum"><a id="page19" name="page19"></a>(p. 19)</span>
pretensions, actually declared war against His Majesty and the United
Provinces; under the circumstances of this wanton and unprovoked
aggression, His Majesty has taken the necessary steps to maintain the
honour of his Crown, and to vindicate the rights of his people; and
His Majesty relies with confidence on the firm and effectual support
of the House of Commons, and on the zealous exertions of a brave and
loyal people, in prosecuting a just and necessary war, and
endeavouring, under the blessing of Providence, to oppose an effectual
barrier to the farther progress of a system which strikes at the
security and peace of all independent nations, and is pursued in open
defiance of every principle of moderation, good faith, humanity, and
justice.</p>

<p>"In a cause of such general concern, His Majesty has every reason to
hope for the cordial co-operation of those Powers who are united with
His Majesty by the ties of alliance, or who feel an interest in
preventing the extension of anarchy and confusion, and in contributing
to the security and tranquillity of Europe.</p>
<p class="sig">G. R."</p>

<p>The Government was determined to do nothing by halves, and, as the law
of nations had not yet condemned the practice, they (on the 12th
February) caused to be issued, by the Admiralty, letters of marque,<a id="footnotetag1" name="footnotetag1"></a><a href="#footnote1" title="Lien vers la note 1"><span class="smaller">[1]</span></a>
and reprisals against the French shipping&mdash;whilst pressgangs scoured
the streets and boarded all vessels for seamen. As, for instance (16th
February), "A press broke out in the river yesterday morning, all the
seamen were taken from the colliers, and the gangs were very
successful." And every means were taken to get sailors to <span class="pagenum"><a id="page20" name="page20"></a>(p. 20)</span>
volunteer, vide the following extract out of a letter from Rochester,
15th February:&mdash;"Three guineas are given to an able-bodied seaman, two
guineas to an ordinary seaman, and one guinea to a landsman (above the
King's bounty), to those who shall enter within a month in this city;
being the voluntary generosity of the Mayor and corporation here." And
this example was followed by many other corporations.</p>

<p>War being declared, preparations for it were carried on with the
utmost vigour. The Duke of York, colonel of the Guards (afterwards on
12th April made general), addressed the three regiments on parade,
told them that he would accompany them to Holland, and asked for
volunteers. This met with an unanimous response, but the number
required being limited, such men, only, were selected, who were judged
fittest for the service, and they started on their expedition on 25th
February, after having been inspected by the King.</p>

<p>It is no part of the scheme of this book to follow the fortunes of the
war, and, as there is little else noteworthy in the year 1793, we pass
to the next year.</p>

<p class="p2">On the 22nd February, 1794, His Majesty sent a message to Parliament,
calling attention to the expediency of increasing the land forces,
and, consequently, a large increase in the militia, and an addition to
the fencible corps, were voted, and the Secretary of State sent a
circular to all the Lords-lieutenant of Counties, recommending them to
solicit voluntary contributions towards carrying on the war.</p>

<p>Wilberforce still continued to agitate the slave question, although
not on the same lines as formerly. He changed his tactics, and, as the
sense of the House, on <span class="pagenum"><a id="page21" name="page21"></a>(p. 21)</span> a previous occasion, was in favour of
gradually doing away with it, he introduced a Bill for abolishing that
part of the slave trade which related to the supply of foreign
plantations. Of course it met with opposition, Sir William Young
moving that it be read a second time this day (26th February) six
months, but it was carried in the Lower House, the numbers for the
second reading being 56 against 38&mdash;majority, 18. The Bill, however,
was thrown out in the Lords, owing to the opposition of Lord
Grenville, who argued that such a Bill should not be introduced whilst
the House was instituting inquiry into the whole question. And so, for
a time, it dropped, perforce.</p>

<p>Many amongst us seem to think that Sir Rowland Hill originated the
penny post, but such is not the fact. That it was mainly through his
instrumentality that letters could be sent to all parts of England,
Scotland, and Ireland, at the uniform price of one penny, and that he
did much to re-organise the vast establishment of the post-office, is
beyond doubt; but the penny post existed long before that. There is a
squabble between Dockwra and Murray as to which of them commenced it
in 1683; at all events, the Government took it from Dockwra in 1690,
and afterwards gave him a pension of £500 a year, and he was made
Controller of the District Post; but he was finally discharged, on
account of some charges of malversation, &amp;c., brought against him.</p>

<p>In 1711 an Act was passed abolishing the penny post, and on June 23rd
of that year a proclamation was issued, putting it in force. But it
was resuscitated, for we find, in the Parliamentary intelligence of
the <cite>Times</cite>, 26th February, 1794: "House of Commons, 25th February.
The House having gone into Committee, Mr. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page22" name="page22"></a>(p. 22)</span> Long proposed some
resolutions to be adopted as an improvement on the mode of carrying
letters by the penny post. It was proposed that letters sent by the
penny post should be carried six times every day, and that an
additional duty of one penny should be paid to the King,&mdash;that is, as
we understand it, that the person who receives the letter shall pay a
penny in all cases, as well as he who sends it. Another resolution
was, that the postage of letters in the islands of Guernsey and Jersey
should be the same as in England." Pitt explained that the extra penny
would, probably, only cover the extra cost involved in having six
deliveries, and, after a short debate, the resolutions passed the
Committee.</p>

<p>The <cite>Times</cite> (28th February 1794), commenting thereon says&mdash;"The new
Penny Post Office is likely to prove such a very great accommodation
to the public, that the only wonder is, it has been so long neglected.
Instead of the numbers of deliveries, and the hours of despatch
varying in different parts of the town, as at present, there will be
six deliveries each day in all parts of the town; by which means a
person living at Mary-le-Bonne may send letters to, or receive letters
from, Limehouse, a distance of seven miles, five times a day....
Persons putting in letters by nine in the morning, at the distance of
ten miles from the chief Penny Post Office, and later, at less distant
parts, may receive answers from London the same afternoon."</p>

<p>The Revolution in France still continued, as did then emigration, for
a return was made of the number of <em lang="fr">emigrés</em>, who had been brought off
from Toulon by the British Fleet, and this report avers that they
numbered 14,877 men, women, and children. No wonder, then, at the
passing of the Alien Act.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page23" name="page23"></a>(p. 23)</span> The French Revolution, no doubt, stirred up the discontented,
and disaffected, in England: the perusal of Paine's "Rights of Man" in
no ways tended to soothe a rebellious feeling, and the mob, on several
occasions, was very riotous. Societies, like the "Corresponding
Society" and the "Society for Constitutional Information," were
founded in London, and the Government, feeling itself strong enough,
was determined to strike a blow and crush them: so, on the 12th May,
the King sent a message to Parliament, saying, that "having received
information that the seditious practices, which have been for some
time carried on by certain societies in different parts of the
country, have lately been pursued with increased activity and
boldness," &amp;c.... he "has given directions for seizing the books and
papers of the said societies in London, which papers have been seized
accordingly, and these books and papers appear to contain matter of
the greatest importance." He directed them to be laid before
Parliament for consideration, so that they might take "measures
thereupon, as may appear to be necessary, for effectually guarding
against the further prosecution of these dangerous designs."</p>

<p>John Thelwall (political lecturer), Daniel Adams, and Thomas Hardy
were taken into custody. The latter two were examined before the Privy
Council on the 13th, the former on the 14th, on which date a Royal
Messenger went to Earl Stanhope's house, and arrested his lordship's
private secretary, the Rev. Jeremiah Joyce. A famous agitator, the
Rev. John Horne Tooke, was also taken. Their trials took place in
October, November, and December 1794, and ended in the acquittal of
the prisoners, after which the Government abandoned similar
prosecutions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page24" name="page24"></a>(p. 24)</span> But a patriotic feeling was abroad, more than enough to
counterbalance these turbulent spirits. The vast majority of the
population was loyal, and volunteers hastened to band together for the
defence of their country. One or two instances will suffice. "On the
17th April the Court of Common Council of the City of London agreed to
open a subscription for raising, and disciplining, a regiment of
infantry and a troop of cavalry for the defence of the city, to be
called the 'Loyal London Volunteers.'"&mdash;"<em>Rutland Volunteers Troops of
Cavalry.</em> On the 5th instant, 154 men and horses, consisting of the
high sheriff, the noblemen, gentlemen, and yeomen, who intend forming
this corps, met at Oakham.... Uniform, French gray and buff. Every
person who belongs to this corps binds himself, under £50 penalty, to
attend when called upon."&mdash;<cite>Times</cite>, 21st April. These two instances
shew the wide range the volunteers' movement&mdash;then in its very
infancy&mdash;took.</p>

<p>The feeling, however, of the nation was not altogether unanimous in
favour of war. There was then, as now, a peace party. On 6th March Mr.
Whitbread moved an address to the King, strongly disapproving of the
policy of the Government, and of their conduct, not only preceding,
but succeeding the war. The Earl of Guildford did the same in the
Lords, but in both Houses the motions were negatived by large
majorities. Nothing daunted by this, on 30th May, the Duke of Bedford,
in the House of Lords, reviewed the causes which led to the war, and
also the foreign policy of the Government, ending by moving fourteen
resolutions, of which the most material were the two following:&mdash;"That
it appeared expedient to that House, that it should recommend to His
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page25" name="page25"></a>(p. 25)</span> Majesty to adopt such measures as might lead to a negotiation
for peace."</p>

<p>Or that, "if His Majesty, in his wisdom, thought it advisable still
to prosecute the war, that he would be most graciously pleased to
state what the object of it was."</p>

<p>After a debate, which lasted till half-past one o'clock, it was
adjourned till the following Monday.</p>

<p>In the Commons, Fox took the same tone, winding up with&mdash;"The
advantages we had gained by sea and land were favourable for the
negotiation of a peace, as they served as so many funds to induce the
enemy to treat; and, should we fail, we should thereby justify our
pacific intentions to the world." He concluded by moving resolutions
similar to those of the Duke of Bedford. The result was&mdash;For the
previous question, 208; for Mr. Fox's resolutions, 55&mdash;majority, 153.
And no more was heard of the Duke of Bedford's resolutions.</p>

<p>The next, and last, great incident was, Lord Howe's great naval
victory over the French off the coast of Ushant, on "the glorious
first of June." Two 80 and five 74 gun ships were the substantial
fruits of this victory, although "Le Vengeur," one of the 74's, sunk
soon after capture, drowning some 300 men. No one knows the French
loss in this battle, but we do know, that on board the prizes taken
there were found 1200 dead bodies. Our total loss was 904. The news
travelled very fast, for that day; Sir Roger Curtis, Howe's first
captain, arrived at the Admiralty with despatches on the evening of
the 10th June.</p>

<p>The jubilation was great, nor was practical sympathy <span class="pagenum"><a id="page26" name="page26"></a>(p. 26)</span> with the
widows and orphans of our seamen wanting. In less than one hour a
thousand guineas were subscribed at Lloyd's for their relief. The
popular rejoicing took the form of illuminating the houses, smashing
Earl Stanhope's windows, and much beer drinking. The thanks of both
Houses of Parliament were given to Earl Howe, and, on his arrival at
Portsmouth, the King, Queen, and the Royal family went down and paid
him a visit on board his own ship, on 29th June. As there is a
crispness, and freshness, about contemporary accounts of events, let
the <cite>Times</cite> (July 1st) tell the story.</p>

<p>"On the King being received on board the 'Queen Charlotte,' he
presented Earl Howe with a diamond hilted sword. His lordship,
perceiving His Majesty's intention, threw the sword he had on his side
upon the deck, and, kneeling, received from the Sovereign's hand this
distinguished proof of approbation. His Majesty also presented a gold
chain, to which a medal is hereafter to be annexed, to Admiral Sir
Alexander Hood, and Rear-Admiral Gardner; the like honour was
conferred on Lord Howe's first captain, Sir Roger Curtis. The wounded
Admirals, Bowyer and Pasley, who consequently could not attend, have
been distinguished with similar marks of His Majesty's favour."</p>

<p>Poor Admirals Bowyer and Pasley had to be pensioned off, on account of
their wounds, in February 1795, the sum awarded to each being £500 per
annum.</p>

<p class="p2">At the commencement of 1795 the French took possession of Utrecht,
Rotterdam, and Dort: the treasure of the Prince of Orange was sent to
London, and the Stadtholder and his family had to make a hurried
flight <span class="pagenum"><a id="page27" name="page27"></a>(p. 27)</span> for their lives in an open boat, luckily reaching
Harwich safely. The French having thus occupied Holland, the English
Government laid an embargo on all Dutch vessels in our ports.</p>

<p>The Opposition still attempted to embarrass the Government on the
question of the War, and, on 26th January, Mr. Grey, in a very lengthy
speech, brought forward a motion, recommending peace with France. Pitt
came forward with an amendment, to the purport that there could be no
security for peace whilst the Government of France was an irregular
one, and, on its being put, it was carried by 269 to 86.</p>

<p>Wilberforce still kept "pegging away" at the Slave Trade, and, on 26th
February, introduced a motion, "for leave to bring in a Bill for the
abolition of the slave trade, at a time to be limited." Pitt lent him
the weight of his influence, but it was a small House, and he lost it
by a majority of 17.</p>

<p>Fox, naturally (being in opposition), was always baiting the
Government, and on 24th March he moved, "That the House should resolve
itself into a Committee to inquire into the state of the nation;" but
he suffered a severe defeat, the numbers against his motion being 219;
for, 63.</p>

<p>The English troops in Holland had met with a series of misadventures,
and were compelled to retreat. A fine array of 35,000 men left our
shores for this expedition, and but about a fifth part could be
mustered when they reached the town of Bremen, on the 27th and 28th of
March&mdash;and right glad were they to embark on board the transports
lying in the Elbe, ready to receive them.</p>

<p class="p2">The harvest of 1794 had been bad, and bread and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page28" name="page28"></a>(p. 28)</span> provisions
generally were so dear as practically to amount to a famine among the
poor. People, as a rule, will, unfortunately, not starve quietly, so
we hear of food riots occasionally. On 11th April a mob at Portsea
attacked the butchers' and bakers' shops, and compelled them with
persuasive eloquence to sell, the one, meat at 4d per lb.&mdash;the other,
bread at 6d a quartern loaf. Again on 20th April, the Oxford Militia,
with loaded guns and fixed bayonets, went to Seaford, where, having
confiscated all the beef and mutton they could lay their hands on,
they sold it at 4d per lb., and then, going to Newhaven, they seized
2000 sacks of flour, and sold it at their own price. This flagrant
breach of military discipline was, however, soon punished, for the
Horse Artillery and Lancashire Fencibles came up and took the rioters
prisoners. But similar riots were rife all through the Midlands.</p>

<p>In the autumn things got even worse, and Parliament was assembled
earlier than usual to deliberate on a remedy for this state of things;
the outcome of which was an order for a bounty of twenty shillings per
quarter on wheat from the Mediterranean, fifteen shillings on wheat
from America, and five shillings per quarter on Indian corn. Bills
also were passed prohibiting the manufacture of starch from wheat, and
also the distillation of spirit from grain.</p>

<p>This scarcity of food, and the heavy burdens, both in taxation, the
levying of men, and the pressgangs, fell sorely on the poor, who
murmured loudly,&mdash;a fact which was duly taken advantage of by the
demagogues for their own seditious purposes. They agitated for
universal suffrage and annual parliaments, and the movement gathered
strength. On the 26th October, the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page29" name="page29"></a>(p. 29)</span> Corresponding Society held
a mass meeting in Copenhagen Fields, and the inflammatory speeches
there delivered, no doubt, bore their fruit three days afterwards,
when the mob stoned the King. As the <cite>Times'</cite> account of this assault
is very meagre, compared with that in the <cite>Annual Register</cite>, I copy
the latter <i lang="la">verbatim</i>.</p>

<p>"<i>29th October.</i>&mdash;On the occasion of His Majesty's going to the House
of Lords, the Mall and the Parade of St. James's Park, and Parliament
Street, were completely choked up with spectators. The crowd was by no
means so great at the Coronation, and, to see the King go to the
House, there never were before more than a tenth part of the numbers
of this day; for they, at least, amounted to 200,000. Several noblemen
and Cabinet Ministers passed through the Park from Buckingham House
about two o'clock. The Earl of Chatham, Duke of Gloucester, &amp;c., were
hissed, and the Duke of Portland was very much hooted.</p>

<p>"About twenty minutes afterwards the King left Buckingham House, and
was violently hissed and hooted and groaned at the whole way; but no
violence was offered till he arrived opposite the Ordnance Office,
when a small pebble, or marble, or bullet, broke one of the windows.
In returning, the moment His Majesty entered the Park the gates of the
Horse Guards were shut, for the purpose of excluding the mob who
followed the carriage; at which, as it passed opposite Spring Gardens
Terrace, another stone was thrown, but it fortunately struck the
woodwork between the windows.</p>

<p>"The crowd now pressed closely round the coach, and His Majesty, in
considerable agitation, signified, by waving his hands to the Horse
Guards on each side, his anxiety that the multitude should be kept at
a distance. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page30" name="page30"></a>(p. 30)</span> In this way he passed on through the Park, and
round by the Stable Yard, into St. James's Palace, at the front gate,
the bottom of St. James's Street. A considerable tumult took place
when His Majesty was about to alight, and one of the horses in the
state coach took fright, threw down an old groom of the name of
Dorrington, and broke one of his thighs, but it proved, fortunately,
a simple fracture; his other thigh was considerably bruised, but not
dangerously.</p>

<p>"A few minutes after His Majesty had entered the palace, the mob
attacked the state coach with stones, and did it great injury. In its
way along Pall Mall to the Mews many things were also thrown at it.
After a short time the King went, in his private coach, from St.
James's to Buckingham House; but, on his way through the Park the mob
surrounded the carriage, and prevented it from proceeding, crying out,
'Bread! Bread! Peace! Peace!'&mdash;The Guards were, however, speedily
brought up, and they protected the carriage till His Majesty got safe
into Buckingham House.</p>

<p>"When His Majesty entered the House of Peers, the first words he
uttered were these, to the Lord Chancellor: 'My Lord, I have been shot
at!' This alluded to the substance which had broke the window while
passing the Ordnance Office.</p>

<p>"Three or four persons were apprehended on suspicion of having thrown
stones, &amp;c., at the King, and one of them was charged with having
called out, 'No king,' and other such expressions. They were all
examined at the Duke of Portland's office; and, waiting the result of
this business, nothing was done in the House of Lords till near six
o'clock, when Lord Westmoreland, who rode in the carriage with the
King, having previously <span class="pagenum"><a id="page31" name="page31"></a>(p. 31)</span> moved 'that strangers be ordered to
withdraw,' stated the insult and outrage with which the King had been
treated; and added that His Majesty, and those who had accompanied
him, were of opinion that the glass of the coach had been broken by a
ball from an air-gun, which had been shot from a bow window of a house
adjoining the Ordnance Office, with a view to assassinate him.</p>

<p>"The King, through the whole of the riot, displayed the cool
magnanimity for which the family have ever been distinguished. At the
time that the glass of the coach was broken, he said to Lord
Westmoreland, 'That is a shot;' and, instead of leaning back in the
carriage, or striving to avoid the assassin, he pointed to the round
hole in the pane, and examined it. But this was not all; he went into
the private coach, to go from St. James's to the Queen's house, in the
midst of the wildest commotions of the multitude, thereby exposing
himself, almost without guards, to their fury; and then it was that
His Majesty's person was most imminently in danger."</p>

<p>"<i>30th October.</i>&mdash;Confident in the attachment of his people,
notwithstanding the alarms of the preceding day, the King, accompanied
by Her Majesty and three of the Princesses, visited Covent Garden
Theatre, and, at their entrance, was received with the usual burst of
applause. 'God save the King' was sung twice, and, by a considerable
part of the house, over-zealously called for a third time; this, in a
corner of the gallery, provoked a few hisses, which, however, were
soon overruled, and one or two of the most active of the turbulent
party were turned out; after which the performance went on."</p>

<p>Five persons were apprehended for this outrage, but <span class="pagenum"><a id="page32" name="page32"></a>(p. 32)</span> with the
exception of one, Kidd Wake, aged 27, a journeyman printer, who owned
to his hissing and hooting at His Majesty, and who was committed to
take his trial on 14th November, I cannot trace their fate; probably
they were discharged for want of evidence.</p>

<p>A Royal Proclamation was issued, offering one thousand pounds reward
to any one "who shall give information, so that any of such authors,
actors, or abettors, as aforesaid, shall be apprehended and brought
to justice."</p>

<p>In November there were fearful storms, especially on the 6th, which
were extraordinarily destructive, both to life and property. One of
these storms was so severely felt at Weymouth, that nearly 1600 dead
bodies were, at different times, thrown up on the beach, 300 being
buried at one time, and, had not the Gloucestershire Militia helped in
burying them, there would, doubtless, have been a pestilence.</p>

<p>On 8th December Pitt, in the House of Commons, delivered a message
from the King, in which occurs the following passage, which must have
been hailed with thanksgiving throughout the length and breadth of the
land:&mdash;"His Majesty, on this occasion, thinks proper to acquaint the
House, that the crisis which was depending<a id="footnotetag2" name="footnotetag2"></a><a href="#footnote2" title="Lien vers la note 2"><span class="smaller">[2]</span></a> at the commencement of
the present session, has led to such an order of things in France, as
will induce His Majesty (conformably to the sentiments which he has
already declared) to meet any disposition to negotiation on the part
of the enemy, with an earnest desire to give it the fullest and
speediest effect, and to conclude a treaty for general peace, whenever
it can be effected on just and suitable terms for himself and his
allies."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page33" name="page33"></a>(p. 33)</span> At the commencement of 1796 the Royal Family were still in bad
odour with a certain section of the public,&mdash;nor can it be wondered at
by any one who has studied the satirical prints of the day. Every
foible of Royalty was noted, exaggerated, engraved on "perennial
brass," exhibited most freely in the shop windows, and most eagerly
purchased. Farmer George, and his simple, and somewhat mean habits,
the Queen's avarice, the Prince of Wales' licentiousness, and
extravagance, and all the scandals (and they were many) appertaining
to the rest of the Royal Family, were ruthlessly laid bare, and
mercilessly exposed to the public gaze.</p>

<p>That this must have tended to lower the Royal Family in most men's
eyes, there can be no doubt, so that we are not very much surprised at
the occasional practical manifestations of the mob. On the night of
1st February, there was more stone-throwing on the part of the
populace, which the <cite>Times</cite> of 3rd February thus describes:&mdash;"On
Monday night, as the Royal Family were returning from Drury Lane
Theatre, just as they reached the middle of Pall Mall, a stone was
flung at the coach in which were their Majesties and the
lady-in-waiting, which broke the glass, and, entering the carriage,
struck the Queen on the cheek, and fell into Lady Harrington's lap.</p>

<p>"A deposition of the circumstances was taken yesterday at the Duke of
Portland's office, at which his Grace and some of the Bow Street
Magistrates were present; when four of the footmen attending their
Majesties were examined; a reward will be immediately offered to
discover the offender." And so it was to the extent of £1000, but
nothing came of it.</p>

<p>Whilst on the subject of the royal unpopularity, I may mention that
Kydd Wake, who last year was <span class="pagenum"><a id="page34" name="page34"></a>(p. 34)</span> apprehended for hissing and
hooting at the King, was tried before Lord Kenyon, for "trespass,
riot, and misdemeanour," and found guilty&mdash;sentence being deferred.
This, however, was pronounced upon him by Mr. Justice Ashurst at the
Court of King's Bench 7th May. His judgment was somewhat long-winded,
and he concluded thus:&mdash;"It now becomes my duty to pronounce the
sentence of the Court; which is, that you be committed to the custody
of the keeper of the Penitentiary House, in, and for, the County of
Gloucester, and be kept to hard labour for the space of five years;
and, within the first three months of that time, that you stand in,
and upon, the Pillory for one hour, between the hours of eleven and
two o'clock in the afternoon, in some public street on a market day;
and that you give sureties in £1000, for your good behaviour for the
term of ten years, to be computed from the expiration of the said five
years; and that you be further imprisoned till you find the said
sureties."</p>

<p>On the 15th February, Mr. Grey, in the House of Commons, again
ventilated the subject of peace, this time in the shape of an address
to the King, praying him to communicate to the executive government of
France, his readiness to meet any disposition to negotiate a general
peace. Both Pitt and Fox spoke on the subject, but the motion was lost
by 189 to 50.</p>

<p>There was one crumb of comfort to the nation, which had hitherto been
suffering from a grievous scarcity of bread-stuffs, and this was the
great fall in wheat, which took place on 31st March. On that date,
owing to the large importations of foreign wheat, this grain fell 13s.
per quarter.</p>

<p>Joy, too, must have sprung up in the national heart <span class="pagenum"><a id="page35" name="page35"></a>(p. 35)</span> when the
King made his speech on the opening of both Houses, 7th October. He
said:&mdash;"I have omitted no endeavours for setting on foot negotiations
to restore peace to <em>Europe</em>, and to secure, for the future, general
tranquillity. The steps I have taken for this purpose have at length
opened the way to an immediate and direct negotiation, the issue of
which must either produce the desirable end of a just, honourable, and
solid Peace for Us, and for Our Allies, or must prove, beyond dispute,
to what cause alone the prolongation of the calamities of war must be
ascribed. I shall immediately send a person to Paris with full powers
to treat for this object, and it is My anxious wish that this measure
may lead to the restoration of General Peace; but you must be sensible
that nothing can so much contribute to give effect to this desire, as
your manifesting that We possess both the determination and the
resources to oppose, with increased activity and energy, the farther
efforts with which We have to contend."</p>

<p>The "person" who was to go over to France as Plenipotentiary, was Sir
James Harris, who had lately been made Lord Malmesbury&mdash;and he arrived
at Paris on 22nd October. The usual diplomatic fencing took place, but
this was brought to an end by a squabble respecting the annexation of
the Netherlands to France. Lord Malmesbury wished to communicate with
his Government on this point, but the Directory meant to force his
hand, and required his ultimatum within twenty-four hours, and, as he
still asked for time, he was told his presence in Paris was useless,
and that he must depart within two days. He replied that he would
leave next day, and demanded his passports. On the 20th December he
left Paris for England, and so ended, for a while, all <span class="pagenum"><a id="page36" name="page36"></a>(p. 36)</span> hopes
of peace. That the French had but faint hopes of a successful end to
the mission is evident, for, during the negotiations, on 2nd November,
the Council of Five Hundred passed a decree, prohibiting the
importation of British goods into the Republic.</p>

<p>As a proof of the patriotism of the English people, and their thorough
reliance on the Government, Pitt asked for a loan of eighteen
millions. This loan, called "The Loyalty Loan," was opened on 5th
December, and in <em>15 hours 20 minutes</em> it was all subscribed. The
<cite>Times</cite> of 6th December says&mdash;"Yesterday, soon after 11 o'clock, the
<span class="smcap">SUBSCRIPTION</span> for <span class="smcap">EIGHTEEN MILLIONS STERLING</span>, for the services of the
ensuing year, closed at the Bank; and such was the general desire to
subscribe, that the Court Room was a scene of the utmost confusion.
Many gentlemen were altogether disappointed; and those who could get
near the books to put down their names, did so with the utmost
difficulty. There was very little remaining to be subscribed; for a
great number of orders had been received by Mr. Newland in the
morning, from the country, which claimed a preference; and,
accordingly, the doors were shut some time, until these commissions
were written down. There is no doubt but that many millions more would
have been subscribed, if the public service had required it. There
cannot be a greater proof of the patriotism of all ranks of people in
thus assisting Government, because, at the time the loan was opened,
the other funds were considerably the cheapest purchase."</p>

<p>Nor was it money only, that our forefathers gave. In October 195,000
men were voted for the land service for the year 1797, and 120,000
seamen and marines for the navy. There was also a levy of 15,000 men,
from the different parishes, for sea service, and recruiting the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page37" name="page37"></a>(p. 37)</span> regiments of the line, and a supplementary militia was raised,
of 60,000 men, not to be immediately called out, but to be enrolled,
officered, and completely trained, so as to be ready in a moment of
danger, and a force of 20,000 irregular cavalry was also embodied.</p>

<p>The year closed with a frost which exceeded in severity any known for
many years. Many people were frozen to death, and the thermometer was
34, and 35 degrees below freezing point.</p>

<p class="p2">1797 opened very gloomily; finance, the backbone of a nation, was
somewhat dislocated. People were alarmed at the rapid growth of the
National Debt, and, selling out of the funds, found other investments
for their capital: there had been an enormous drain of bullion to
subsidise the allies, and Pitt had borrowed from the Bank in the most
reckless manner. It was in vain that the Bank remonstrated with him,
but still he borrowed, so that at last he had to be told that if he
took any more, it would probably lead to the insolvency of the Bank.
There was a run upon the country banks, and its effects were soon felt
in London; and, on 26th, an order of the Privy Council was made,
forbidding the Bank of England from making cash payments, until
Parliament had been consulted. On inquiry, it was found that the Bank
was not only perfectly solvent, but, after payment of all liabilities,
its capital would amount to £9,660,290. Under these circumstances Mr.
Pitt brought in a bill (37 George III. cap. 28), permitting the Bank
to issue notes from 20s. upwards, in lieu of cash. This measure
brought relief, and saved the National credit.</p>

<p>Perhaps one of the chief National events in the year, was the mutiny
of the fleets. Looking at it from this <span class="pagenum"><a id="page38" name="page38"></a>(p. 38)</span> distance of time, one
can hardly wonder at it, especially when we consider the way in which
the crews were procured, by impressment and otherwise, their hard
fare, the bad accommodation for them, the frequent punishments, from
50 to 500 lashes, at the discretion of a possibly irate captain,
frequently for venial offences; add to this, small pay, and constant
work, and we are fain to acknowledge that the men who could stand such
treatment tamely, were almost more than human.</p>

<p>Yet they stated their grievances very properly, and quietly, sending
petitions, either in February, or March, to Lord Howe, begging him to
use his influence with the Admiralty, to procure them an increase of
wages, and an improvement in the quality, and quantity, of their
provisions. No notice whatever was taken of this temperate
remonstrance, so the men, finding no help came to them, tried to help
themselves, and secret communication was opened between all the
vessels of the fleet. No one can defend the gross breach of discipline
of which they were guilty, but it must be remembered that they were
ignorant men, smarting under a sense of injury, rendered especially
galling, by their just complaints, and moderate demands, being utterly
ignored.</p>

<p>Their plot to seize the ships, and expel the officers, came to be
known, and, on 15th April, Admiral Lord Bridport, in obedience to
orders from the Admiralty, signalled for the fleet to sail. But the
men refused to put to sea (unless an enemy was known to be at sea),
until their grievances had been examined into, and redressed. A
deputation, of two men from each ship, met in the Admiral's cabin, and
another petition was drawn up. On the 18th, a Committee of the Lords
of the Admiralty went to Portsmouth, to investigate the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page39" name="page39"></a>(p. 39)</span>
seamen's claims; and the result was, that Admiral Bridport returned to
his ship on 23rd April, and, having hoisted his flag, he told his crew
that he brought with him the redress of all their grievances, and the
King's pardon for all offenders.</p>

<p>One would imagine that this would satisfy them, coming as it did from
the mouth of their "father and friend," but when, on the 7th of May,
he signalled to put to sea, no ship would obey him. The fact is, the
men were suspicious; they had been so badly treated with regard to the
granting of their moderate demands, that they thought the order for
sailing was only a ruse to get them away, and then faith would not be
kept with them. This mutiny was unfortunately accompanied by
bloodshed, and it lasted until the 14th May. On the 11th, Lord Howe
visited the fleet, saw the delegates, and assured them, that before a
Royal pardon could be proclaimed, they must express contrition for
their conduct. This they did, but solemnly declared they would never
again receive on board those officers they had sent on shore. This was
agreed to, and Lord Howe, on the 14th of May, showed them an Act of
Parliament, which granted what they wished, and the fleet at St.
Helens were, for a time, content.</p>

<p>But, at the Nore, there was much discontent, or rather open mutiny;
the men had forced the Admiralty to grant their demands, and now
thought they could go in for more; and, to enforce it, they attempted
to blockade the Thames, and prevent any vessel from entering or
departing,&mdash;and they did fire on several that attempted to run the
blockade. Of course, such a state of things could not last long, and
the removal of all the buoys, by the Admiralty, helped to bring about
a surrender. Their <span class="pagenum"><a id="page40" name="page40"></a>(p. 40)</span> provisions began to run short, and the
Government peremptorily refused to accede to their demands. Some of
the fleet left, and returned to their duty, on the 9th June. On the
10th, more struck the red flag, and on the 12th, there were but seven
left that were not flying the Union Jack; and next day, five of them
sought the protection of Sheerness.</p>

<p>The mutiny was now at an end, and it only remained to deal with the
ringleaders, the chief of whom was named Richard Parker, and he, and
several others, were duly hanged. Many who were sentenced to death
were, however, pardoned, and a general veil of oblivion was wisely
thrown over the whole affair, as soon as the men returned to their
duty.</p>

<p>Earlier in the year occurred a curious page in our history, nothing
less than a practical invasion of England by the French, details of
which can best be learned from contemporary accounts.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p class="center">"<span class="smcap">London Gazette, Extraordinary</span>, February 25.</p>

     <p>"A letter this day received by the Duke of Portland, from Lord
     Milford, Lord-Lieutenant of the County of Pembroke, dated
     <i>Haverfordwest, February 23rd, 5</i> <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, contains information that
     two frigates, a corvette, and a lugger, appeared off the coast of
     Pembrokeshire the 22nd inst., and on the evening of that day
     disembarked some troops reported by deserters to be about 1200,
     but without field-pieces."</p>
</div>

<div class="quote">
     <p class="center">"<span class="smcap">London Gazette, Extraordinary</span>, February 26.</p>

     <p>"<i>Haverfordwest, February 24, 1797, 6 o'clock</i> <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>&mdash;Since I had
     the honour of writing last to your Grace by Express, I have
     received information of the French ships <span class="pagenum"><a id="page41" name="page41"></a>(p. 41)</span> having sailed,
     and left 300 men behind, who have surrendered themselves
     prisoners. The great Spirit and Loyalty that the Gentlemen and

     thousands of the latter assembled, armed with pikes, and scythes,
     and attacked the enemy, previous to the arrival of the Troops

     <p>"<i>February 24th, 9 o'clock</i> <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>&mdash;I have the honour and pleasure
     to inform your Grace, that the whole of the French troops,
     amounting to near 1400 men, have surrendered, and are now on
     their march to Haverfordwest."</p>
</div>

<p>And so ends the invasion of England.</p>

<p>On 14th February, Admiral Sir John Jervis, with fifteen sail of the
line, attacked the Spanish Fleet of twenty-seven sail of the line, off
Cape St. Vincent, captured four large vessels, and dispersed the
fleet. The news reached England on 3rd March, when London was
brilliantly illuminated.</p>

<p>The Whigs moved heaven and earth in order to oust Pitt and his
Government, but without success. On March 3rd the inhabitants of
Westminster met in Palace Yard, and resolved to petition the King to
dismiss his Ministry. In the City, too (the bones of whose <i lang="la">patres
conscripti</i> would shake with indignation, could they but know of the
present wave of Conservatism, which has flowed over this Corporation),
loud, and many, were the calls to the same purport. In vain were
Common Halls convened, in vain did the Remembrancer, and the Sheriffs,
wait upon his Majesty with petitions; he would have none of them, but
would be glad to see them at a Levée; and so Pitt kept in,
notwithstanding the growls all round.</p>

<p>France was making peace with its enemies, one by one, and it could
easily be foreseen that, very shortly, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page42" name="page42"></a>(p. 42)</span> England would have to
bear all the brunt of the war; therefore, on the 1st June, a note from
Lord Grenville was presented to M. de la Croix, the French Minister
for Foreign Affairs, in which was expressed the wish of the English
Government to negotiate preliminaries of peace. Of course there was
some diplomatic fence; but, finally, it was settled that Lord
Malmesbury should again go as Plenipotentiary. He arrived at Lisle on
6th July, but the demands of the French were outrageous, and, after,
in vain, combating their absurd requirements, he demanded his
passports, and left Lisle on 18th September.</p>

<p>On 11th October, Admiral Duncan attacked the Dutch fleet off
Camperdown, and, after a terrible action, defeated it, capturing
eleven vessels, and sinking one.</p>

<p>About the last event of national interest, occurring in this year, is
the formation of the French "Army of England," which was destined for
our invasion, and which was to be under the command of General
Buonaparte, which is about the first time our great enemy came into
active collision with us.</p>

<p class="p2">At the commencement of 1798, the financial pressure on the nation,
caused by the war, was very great. A triple assessed tax, a loan of
£15,000,000, additional duties on salt, tea, dogs, horses and
carriages, and a tax on armorial bearings, came home to every one.
Yet, English patriotism was sound to the core, and the people helped
the Government nobly, by means of voluntary contributions. A few
examples will show how every class vied with each other in
subscribing. They are taken from the <cite>Times</cite>.</p>

<p><i>February 7th.</i>&mdash;"Yesterday the Marquis of Buckingham subscribed at
the Bank, the profits of one year's <span class="pagenum"><a id="page43" name="page43"></a>(p. 43)</span> income from his Tellership
of the Exchequer. On Monday the Duke of Marlborough subscribed £5000
at the Bank. The city of Oxford has subscribed £500 as a voluntary
donation, to be continued for three years, if the war lasts so long."</p>

<p><i>February 8th.</i>&mdash;"The subscriptions yesterday at the Bank amounted to
upwards of £30,000. Among the subscribers were&mdash;the Earl of Carlisle
£4000, and the Bishop of Litchfield and Coventry £1000. But the
largest individual subscriptions are expected from Manchester, from
whence letters were yesterday received, stating that three mercantile
houses in that opulent town had subscribed <span class="smcap">Thirty-five Thousand
Pounds</span>, and that Mr. Peele's house gave £20,000."</p>

<p>On the 9th February a meeting, on this subject, was held at the Royal
Exchange, the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and most prominent citizens being
present&mdash;and the result is thus stated in the <cite>Times</cite>, 10th
February:&mdash;"As soon as the meeting was dissolved, four separate books
were opened on the Hustings; and at the close of the day, the exact
sum subscribed <em>in cash</em>, was <em>Forty-six Thousand, Five Hundred, and
Thirty-four Pounds, Three Shillings and sixpence</em>, which, if
calculated for the time the books were opened, is at the rate of £400
a minute. The number of subscribers was 218, and the subscriptions
from one guinea to £3000, which last sum was the donation of Boyd,
Benfield, &amp; Co., with the promise of continuing it annually during the
war."</p>

<p><i>14th February.</i>&mdash;"The City of London yesterday subscribed £10,000
towards the contributions to the Bank. Yesterday the sum of £18,900
was subscribed by the merchants on the Royal Exchange."</p>

<p>It would be wearisome to detail all the subscriptions, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page44" name="page44"></a>(p. 44)</span> but yet
two or three more may be recorded. The Bank of England gave £200,000,
and the King and Queen £20,000, and £5000 respectively, out of their
private purses; and on 20th September the amount of the voluntary
contributions then subscribed, was £1,514,993, 12s. 9d.</p>

<p>Ireland, this year, was more than disaffected: it was in open
rebellion, and, on 30th March, a proclamation was issued by the
Lord-Lieutenant, for suppressing such rebellion. That it was a most
serious one, is evidenced by a paper in Lord Edward Fitzgerald's
handwriting, that, at a meeting held 26th February 1798, a return was
made that there were in Ulster, Leinster, and Munster, 269,896 armed
men, and that their treasurer had £1485, 4s. 9d. in hand. That this
was not altogether an exaggeration, is shewn by the fact that, in the
year 1797, there were seized by the Government, in the provinces of
Leinster, and Ulster, alone, 49,109 guns, 1756 bayonets, 4463 pistols,
4183 swords, 248 blunder-busses, 119 musket-barrels, 106 sword-blades,
22 pieces of ordnance, and 70,630 pikes, besides other weapons
voluntarily surrendered. In the same year, 14,973 pikes were
surrendered in the county of Kildare alone, and in Dublin, on 11th May
1798, 5 pieces of cannon, and 500 pike handles, were seized.</p>

<p>On 24th May, seeing that war was being openly waged against the
Government, the Lord-Lieutenant issued a proclamation warning the
people that they were put under martial law, and, on the morrow, the
rebels were defeated, with much loss, near Carlow, and, after the
engagement, about 200 of them were hanged, or shot. Then the rebels
gained a slight advantage, especially at Enniscorthy, where they
compelled the garrison to retreat. This, and a few other small
successes, were amply <span class="pagenum"><a id="page45" name="page45"></a>(p. 45)</span> avenged by Lord Lake, on 21st June, at
Vinegar Hill, a position which the Irish had held since the 28th May.
Their rout was complete, and their slaughter must have been immense,
for no quarter was given by the Royal troops. Then came the trials of
the ringleaders, and the gibbet was in constant requisition.</p>

<p>And, now, the French must needs have a finger in this pie, although
their attempt at invasion was simply ludicrous. The following is the
first official news, and it is a letter from the Duke of Portland to
the Lord Mayor:&mdash;"<i>27th August.</i> I think it right to inform your
Lordship, that, by official accounts received this morning from the
Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, it appears that three French frigates,
unaccompanied by any transports, appeared in the Bay of Killala, on
the evening of the 22nd instant, and landed about 700 men, who
immediately took possession of the town of Killala, and made a small
party of the Prince of Wales' Fencible Regiment, consisting of an
officer and 20 men, and some yeomen, prisoners; a large force is
collecting from different quarters, and every necessary preparation
making for attacking the enemy."</p>

<p>This expedition, consisting of 1030 privates and 70 officers under
General Humbert, had sailed from Rochelle, with the intention of
rendering material help to the Irish rebels&mdash;and, after the capture of
Killala, they marched on Castlebar, where was a force of from 2000 to
3000 regulars, under Lord Lake. The English artillery, however,
expended their ammunition too soon; a fact the French did not lose
sight of, but, charging, put the English force to flight, and they
then occupied Castlebar. But here was the end of their
success&mdash;General Lake and Lord Cornwallis surrounded them, and the
French <span class="pagenum"><a id="page46" name="page46"></a>(p. 46)</span> had to surrender, but no quarter was given to the
Irish. The number of French troops, on their surrender, was 96
officers, and 748 non-commissioned officers and privates, the rest
having been lost since their landing at Killala. This force was
intended to be the vanguard of a larger expedition, which was
prevented joining, by want of funds.</p>

<p>Another little expedition set sail from France, to help General
Humbert, consisting of one ship of the line, eight frigates, a
schooner, and a brig. It was met by Sir John Borlase Warren, who was
cruising, with seven sail of the line, off Lough Swilly. They engaged,
and, after an action of three hours and forty minutes' duration, the
French three-decker, and three of the frigates, hauled down their
colours, and of the five frigates that then escaped, three were
subsequently captured.</p>

<p>The rebellion in Ireland was now virtually at an end, the rebels were
dispersed, and their leaders accounted for. Still, this result was not
arrived at without a fearful expenditure of treasure and life; it
being estimated that not less than 30,000 lives had been sacrificed.
£1,000,000 was voted by Parliament, as compensation for injury done to
the Loyalists in Ireland, and that sum was reckoned as only being a
third of their actual losses.</p>

<p>On the 1st August of this year was fought the battle of the Nile; the
news of which, however, did not reach the Admiralty until the 2nd
October, and great were the rejoicings, and illuminations, on the 3rd.
With this welcome news, the chronicle of the year may well end.</p>

<p class="p2">As far as we can judge, from the lights of history which are left to
us, nothing was going particularly wrong with the national arms, or
the national prosperity, considering we were at war, but the powers,
that were, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page47" name="page47"></a>(p. 47)</span> thought things might possibly go better, if they
had a General Fast, so, on the 1st February, 1799, a proclamation was

<p>"<span class="smcap">George R.</span>&mdash;We, taking into Our most serious consideration the just
and necessary War, in which We are engaged, for the Maintenance of the
Independence of Our Crown, for the Defence and Protection of the
Commerce, and of the Rights and Liberties, Civil and Religious, of Our

Kingdom of <i>Great Britain</i> called <i>England</i>, Our Dominion of <i>Wales</i>,
and <i>Town of Berwick upon Tweed</i>, on <i>Wednesday</i>, the Twenty-seventh
Day of this instant <i>February</i>; that so both We and Our People may
humble Ourselves before Almighty God, in order to obtain Pardon of Our
Sins; and may, in the most devout and solemn Manner, send up Our
Prayers and Supplications to the Divine Majesty, for averting those
Heavy Judgments which Our manifold Sins and Provocations have most
justly deserved; and imploring His Blessing and Assistance on Our
Arms, and for restoring and perpetuating Peace, Safety and Prosperity,
to Us and Our Kingdoms," &amp;c. &amp;c. There were special forms of prayer
for morning, communion, and evening services.</p>

<p>In January, and February, there was much agitation as to the union
with Ireland, to which the Irish Parliament, by small majorities, was
agreeable; but it was reserved till 1st January, 1801, to become an
accomplished fact.</p>

<p>After besieging St. Jean d'Acre for sixty days, in vain, Napoleon
determined to raise the siege, and, on the 20th <span class="pagenum"><a id="page48" name="page48"></a>(p. 48)</span> May, his army
began its return march to Egypt. He threw his heavy artillery into the
sea, not being able to transport it across the desert, and the English
had previously captured his battering train. It need scarcely be said
that there was great rejoicing in England.</p>

<p>Volunteers had sprung up as if by magic, and it was felt that it would
do good, if they received some direct recognition from royalty, and
were reviewed by the King. Accordingly, the time was fixed for the 4th
of June, and the place, Hyde Park. I know I shall be pardoned if I
give a list of the corps who were then reviewed, as so many of the
modern Volunteers must be ignorant that their progenitors were present
on this occasion.</p>

<p>In all, there were 8193 effective men, and the Review was very
successful, the only exception that was taken to it being, that some
of the newly-embodied Corps did not fire with perfect regularity.
Every Londoner is familiar with the statue in Pall Mall, of George
III. on horseback, doffing his cocked hat. Well, that was how he
appeared at this Review, which happened on his birthday. On the 21st,
he, and all the young Princes, inspected some 12,200 men, in a very
curious fashion. The Corps were not brigaded, as in Hyde Park, but
were inspected in their different districts. The Royal party started
at a quarter before 9 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, returned to Buckingham House at 6 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>,
and then set off for Windsor, a good day's work! especially as it all,
with the exception of the journey to Windsor, had to be done on
horseback. The King, and party, were to have gone to Leman Street,
Whitechapel, to inspect the Shoreditch, Whitechapel, and Mile End
Volunteers, but he could not get so far, so turned up Houndsditch, to
Finsbury. The only refreshment, and rest, the Royal party seem to have
had, was breakfast with the Lord Chancellor, at his house in Upper
Guildford Street, where they remained an hour and a-half.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page50" name="page50"></a>(p. 50)</span> The history of the remainder of the year is centred in
Napoleon Buonaparte. On 23rd of August, he suddenly left Egypt,
affairs in France requiring his presence there, if he would look after
his own interests. Had he not done so, it is probable that the world
would never have heard so much of him; as it was, he was elected the
First Consul of the three,&mdash;Cambacérès, and Le Brun, being his
coadjutors.</p>

<p>On the 25th December of this year, Napoleon committed a solecism in
diplomatic etiquette, by writing an autograph letter direct to George
III., pointing out how each nation was wasting its strength and
resources, and suggesting the possibility, and desirability, of peace.
Lord Grenville replied to this letter, through Talleyrand, much to
Napoleon's disgust, and expressed his regret that the English
Government did not yet see its way to enter into negotiations for a
peace, which would not, in all probability, be a lasting one.</p>

<p>This year will close with a report of the number of French prisoners
in England, taken December 31, when they were delivered over to our
Transport Board, the Consular Government refusing to provide for them
any longer.</p>

<h2><span class="pagenum"><a id="page51" name="page51"></a>(p. 51)</span> MEN'S DRESS.</h2>

<p>The latter part of the last century was noticeable for the great, and
grave, mutations which took place in masculine attire, and, most
particularly, during the times here treated of. Previously, the wig,
and dress (quaker cut) coat, had long had a successful run, but people
visited the Continent more, especially France, and brought back French
fashions, which at this time were particularly fantastic. The Prince
of Wales, too, delighted in fine dress, and was "<i lang="la">arbiter
elegantiarum</i>" of his sex. At every levée, and public appearance, his
dress was always expatiated on, and the "gilded youth" of the period,
dressed <em>up</em> to him, and copied his manner, even to his bow.</p>

<p>We, in our days, cannot afford to jeer at the accompanying
illustration, when we see, in the advertisement sheets of some of our
periodicals, men's stays advertised, and even vividly depicted; and,
therefore, we must not throw the first stone of laughter at the
fashions of 1788.</p>

<p>Here we see the transition stage, the modification of the old courtly
wig, with its accompanying powder, and black silk bag for the <em>queue</em>,
now only to be seen pinned on to the coat collars of court officials,
and extremely magnificent <i lang="la">major domos</i>, &amp;c., and, also, we see the
old court dress coat has now taken unto itself a collar, of that
exaggerated description which was so much in <span class="pagenum"><a id="page52" name="page52"></a>(p. 52)</span> vogue during the
next twenty years. Frilled shirts, and ruffles, still existed, and the
curious custom of wearing two watches was the fashion. Here, again,
history has somewhat repeated itself in our modern double watch-chain,
except that now only one watch is worn, the other side guarding a
sovereign purse.</p>

<p>Brighthelmstone or Brighton&mdash;beloved of George the Magnificent,
whether as Prince, Regent, or King&mdash;was the place where the
fashionable youth congregated, and therefore we may take the following
extract from the <cite>Morning Post</cite> (the <em>doyen</em> of the Daily Press) of
18th September, 1788:&mdash;</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p class="center">"<span class="smcap">Brighton Dress.</span></p>

     <p>"The fashionable bathing dress, at Brighton, is chiefly a pair of
     <em>buff trousers</em>, with a slight jacket.</p>

     <p>"This is adopted by all the young men of the place, and a number
     of idle, sauntering <em>land lubbers</em> meet the eye every morning on
     the <span class="smcap">Steyne</span>, that one cannot help wishing for a sturdy <em>pressgang</em>
     to give them useful employment, or at least keep them out of
     mischief.</p>

     <p>"After breakfast they are accoutred for the sports of the field.</p>

     <p>"The <em>sporting dress</em> is a <em>brown jacket</em>, with a multiplicity of
     pockets, on each side, that reaches from the bottom to the top,
     so that, from this appearance, it is somewhat difficult to
     determine which the fashionable tribe most resemble&mdash;a set of
     grooms, or a company of smugglers.</p>

     <p>"When the dinner hour arrives, after these sprightly and heroic
     gentlemen have '<em>slain their thousands, and ten thousands</em>,'
     according to their own account, in the field, with as little
     <em>winking and blinking</em> as <span class="smcap">Major Sturgeon</span> himself, they then
     attire themselves in order to enjoy the pleasures of the table,
     and, however deranged they may afterwards be by convivial excess,
     they march or <em>stagger</em> away to <em>the Rooms</em>, as circumstances may
     determine, and entertain the Ladies with <em>elegant</em> and <em>decent</em>
     gallantry."</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page53" name="page53"></a>(p. 53)</span> About this time flourished that curious being, the
"<em>Macaroni</em>," but most of his portraits are evidently such gross
caricatures, that I have not cared to reproduce them. I have been
compelled to draw upon the satirical prints of the period, as a future
historian would take the pictures from <cite>Punch</cite>, if he wanted to hit
the passing folly of the day; but we must not forget that the
satirical prints of the last century, did not their spiriting so
gently as our modern caricaturists, but exaggerated in every way, in
facial expression, and in costume.</p>

<p>The following brace of <em>Macaronis</em> is taken from a print of the "<cite>Mock
Duel, or a trip to Flanders</cite>," 26th May, 1789: and, although the
costume is scrupulously correct, yet one can hardly help thinking that
the designer of the wig, which was typical of the genus, has somewhat
"drawn upon his imagination for his facts." The name <em>Macaroni</em> was
applied, in derision, to those youths who had made the <em>Grand Tour</em>,
and were fond, on their return, of shewing off their superior graces,
and extolling the polished manners, and superior civilization, of the
countries they had visited. In those days you were nothing unless
classical. Modern languages were rarely taught, Science was all but
unknown, Latin and Greek were the chief branches of education, and
rich men were keen collectors of everything classical, marble statues
and busts, bronzes, and coins&mdash;so Italy was naturally the bourne of
these travelled youths, and John Bull, who then was, in the aggregate,
a very stay-at-home animal, derided them, when they came back, with
the epithet <em>Macaroni</em>, an elegant title derived from the popular
Italian dish.</p>

<p>The home-keeping youths imitated their brethren as well as they could,
but it was at a very humble distance, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page54" name="page54"></a>(p. 54)</span> and their dress, though
partially modelled on that of their confrères, was much exaggerated,
and did not display such simplicity or good taste.&mdash;John Bull had a
name ready for him; a home-manufactured Macaroni was "a Jessamy."</p>

<p>These <em>Jessamies</em> were, like the modern <em>Mashers</em>, effeminate, and
comparatively harmless beings&mdash;entirely taken up with the
contemplation of their external appearance, and the attempted
subjugation of the other sex.</p>

<p>See the following quotation from the <cite>Morning Post</cite> 4th July
1789:&mdash;"There is not a man in the nation, no not even <span class="smcap">Lord Effingham</span>,
who bestows so much time and attention in rendering the external
appearance of his head, elegant in the extreme, than the <span class="smcap">Earl</span> of
<span class="smcap">Scarborough</span>. It is said that his Lordship keeps six French frizeurs,
who have nothing else to do than dress his hair. <span class="smcap">Lord Effingham</span> keeps
only <span class="smcap">Five</span>!!!"</p>

<p>The <em>Jessamies</em>, however, were only one class among the youth of the
time, and I fear, by far the smallest. The majority were what we now
should term "fast." Animal spirits in young men must have vent
somehow.</p>

<p>There were then no rowing, cycles, or other means of getting rid of
the superfluous energy they possessed. Men's social habits were not
at all of a "blue riband" nature, and, after dinner, the bottle
circulated freely. So those who, like Charles Reade's description of
modern athletic young men, knew "only one language, and lived
principally in the open air," naturally became either "A choice
Spirit," "A Buck," or "A Blood," descendants of the "Hectors,"
"Muns," "Titiretus," "Scourers," and "Mohocks"&mdash;men that hustled
honest folk, sang roaring, maudlin, filthy songs&mdash;men from whom no
woman was <span class="pagenum"><a id="page55" name="page55"></a>(p. 55)</span> safe; who, armed with bludgeons, and going in
company in large numbers, boxed the watch, set the constables at
defiance, and made night hideous with their brawls and shouting.</p>

<p class="caption">Macaronis (From the Mock Duel, 1789.)</p>
</div>

<p>Far be it from me to say that the whole youth of this age could be
classed either in one, or other, of these two categories; there were
good young men who probably "always came home to their tea," well
dressed, well read, well mannered&mdash;such as "A Smart."</p>

<p>As a rule, even now-a-days, a man when in the country, very seldom, or
never, carries an umbrella: to a Londoner it is part of his costume.
In Anne's reign the use of the umbrella was strictly set apart for the
softer sex, and then only for those whose avocations compelled them to
be out, whatever the weather. As Gay says in his "<cite>Trivia</cite>"&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
  "The tuck'd-up sempstress walks with hasty strides,<br />
  While streams run down her oil'd umbrella's sides."</p>

<p>But for men, fie! he must be an effeminate coxcomb who would carry
one. Hear what fun was made of him (<cite>Female Tatler</cite>, December
12):&mdash;"The Young Gentleman belonging to the Custom House, that for
fear of rain borrowed the umbrella at Will's Coffee House in Cornhill
of the <em>Mistress</em>, is hereby advertised that to be dry from head to
foot on the like occasion, he shall be welcome to the <cite>Maid's
Pattens</cite>."</p>

<p>One John Macdonald, a footman, who wrote his own biography, helps us
to fix a date when the use of them, by men, was so rare as to make the
user singular. He says that he had "a fine silk umbrella, which he
brought from Spain; but he could not, with any comfort to himself,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page56" name="page56"></a>(p. 56)</span> use it, the people calling out 'Frenchman! why don't you get a
coach?'" However, he "persisted for three months, till they took no
further notice of this novelty. Foreigners began to use theirs, and
then the English." Macdonald wrote in 1778. Jonas Hanway, the
philanthropist, who had travelled much in Persia and the East, is said
to have been the first Englishman who habitually carried an umbrella
whilst walking in the street. He died in 1786.</p>

<p>That it was not in general use in the year 1790, is evidenced by the
somewhat sneering title of a "Rain Beau," or one that was afraid of a
drop of rain. This illustration shews several modifications of fashion
besides the use of the umbrella. The cocked hat had gone out&mdash;and the
galling yoke of the "chimney pot" was being inaugurated. As yet it was
limp, of felt, but there is the hideous head covering that has
martyrised at least three generations.</p>

<p>Then we cannot but notice that the hair has lost all trace of the
wig&mdash;and is allowed to be worn "<i lang="fr">au naturel</i>." A huge cravat swathes
the throat, the coat is cut shorter, and more fly-away than hitherto,
that knee breeches are disappearing, and pantaloons coming in, to be
in their turn superseded by the modern trouser. Lastly, the term
<em>Macaroni</em>, or <em>Jessamy</em>, is replaced by <em>Beau</em>&mdash;which will soon have
to give way to <em>Dandy</em>.</p>

<p>Jimmy Lincum Feadle shows us the Beau of 1791. Here the fashion is
evidently imported from France&mdash;loud coloured striped
coat&mdash;pantaloons, boots and all. The French Revolution was hastening
on, rapidly, to its culmination, and, the younger Whigs, before the
time came when they were utterly disgusted by the brutal <span class="pagenum"><a id="page57" name="page57"></a>(p. 57)</span>
excesses of the French, copied the dress of the Revolutionary party.</p>

<a id="img007" name="img007"></a>
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/img007.jpg" width="241" height="450" alt="" title="A Jessamy.&mdash;1790." />

<p class="caption">A Choice Spirit.<span class="add3em">&nbsp;</span> A Buck.</p>
</div>

<p>The accompanying illustration will show how far they succeeded. There
is an elaborately studied negligence about the coat, and a height
about the hat, which could never be of native production, whilst the
bludgeon must have belonged to some "Merveilleux," (the class whom
Bonaparte so cordially detested), and have been imported direct from
Paris. The supercilious look, and the mincing gait, are warranted
truly Parisian, and I have very little doubt but that Isaac Cruikshank
sketched him from the life.</p>

<p>The term "a Crop," is indicative of Revolutionary and Republican
sympathies. Lucius Junius Brutus, and all the ancient Romans, wore
their hair cut short&mdash;and so we must needs copy them, and have a
revolution in hair cutting, just to show the outer world what our
thoughts are on the present position of political parties. The
elaborate hair of the <em>Macaroni</em> or the <em>Jessamy</em>, or even the
negligent, but natural <em lang="fr">chevelure</em> of the <em>Beau</em>, would not suit
Republican simplicity, and, as in our own Commonwealth, the men of the
Republic cropped their heads, as a testimony against their political
opponents, so did they in 1791. The Duke of Bedford, especially,
attracted public attention, by having his hair cut short, and many are
the allusions to him, with respect to it, in the public prints.</p>

<p>But with 1792 came another change of fashion, of which we get two
views, back and front, and as they are by a lady (Miss Keate), they
are probably not caricatured.</p>

<p>Here we see a return to a more natural style of dress, the colours of
which, in "<em>Neck or Nothing</em>," are well <span class="pagenum"><a id="page58" name="page58"></a>(p. 58)</span> chosen, and very
becoming. Of course the awful cravat is of white cambric or muslin,
and he wears a pink underwaistcoat, white over-waistcoat, and
knee-breeches, a mulberry-coloured coat, and blue and white stockings;
hair powdered.</p>

<p>"A back view of the cape" is not so felicitous as regards colour,
being somewhat "<em lang="fr">prononcé</em>." The coat is green, breeches yellow,
necktie yellow, stockings grey, powdered hair, and a liberal supply of
powder on the back of the coat.</p>

<p>In order to keep this hair powder on the hair, it was necessary to
saturate it with some kind of grease, even if only a tallow dip, or
rushlight, were used; but an advertisement in the <cite>Times</cite>, of 7th
February 1793, gives us some notion as to the antiquity of Bears'
Grease, which must have been undoubtedly genuine, if the last
paragraph can be taken as a fact:&mdash;</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"JUST KILLED, an extraordinary fine Fat <span class="smcap">Russian Bear</span>, at Ross's
     Ornamental Hair and Perfumery Warehouse, No. 119 Bishopsgate
     Street (late Vickery's), three doors from the London Tavern.</p>

     <p>"The excellent virtue which the fat of Bears possesses, has been
     experienced by thousands of both sexes, and of all Ages, in this
     Metropolis. To those who have used the real Bears' Grease, it is
     evident no Grease whatever beside, retains its moisture so long
     upon the head, it being the only thing possible to make the Hair
     grow thick and long, recover it after illness, prevent it
     falling off, or turning grey, during life: being the most
     efficacious remedy for making the Hair grow on Horses' knees
     when broken or chafed.</p>

     <p>"It is sold at 1s. per ounce, or 16s. the pound, to be seen cut
     off the Animal in the presence of the purchaser."</p>
</div>

<p><i>Apropos</i> of "cropping," take the following skit from the <cite>Times</cite>,
January 21, 1794:&mdash;</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page59" name="page59"></a>(p. 59)</span> "<span class="smcap">Sir Robert Mackworth</span> is at Bath, and seems to be no
     otherways distinguished than by the particularity of his
     equipage: he drives four horses of different colours in his
     phaeton, which has four wheels painted to correspond with the
     colours of the horses: in the midst of his badge of distinction,
     the bloody hand, is the figure of 4, which he explains in this
     way, four in hand. The motto 'This is the Tippy.' If anything can
     add to the folly of the whole it is that he intends to crop four
     opposite ears of his horses, to make room for four monstrous
     roses, of different colours, to match."</p>

     was held in the afternoon, and, at night, a Ball at St. James'.
     The <span class="smcap">Gentlemen's</span> dresses were in general embroidered silks and

     <p>"<span class="smcap">His Majesty</span>, as usual on his own Birthday, was in a plain suit

     wear their faces under <em>red masks</em>. They go to bed as blooming as

<p>By the 35 Geo. III., c. 49&mdash;a Duty was laid on Hair powder&mdash;and "the
Crops," besides their (as we should term it) Radical tendencies, were
extra unpopular among <span class="pagenum"><a id="page61" name="page61"></a>(p. 61)</span> the Tories, because they evaded the Hair
Powder duty, by wearing none:&mdash;</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"A numerous club has been formed in Lambeth, called the <em>Crop
     Club</em>, every member of which, on his entrance, is obliged to have
     his head docked as close as the Duke of Bridgewater's old bay
     coach-horses. This assemblage is instituted for the purpose of
     opposing, or rather evading, the tax on powdered
     heads."&mdash;(<cite>Times, April 14, 1795.</cite>)</p>

     <p>"The following Noblemen and Gentlemen were of the party with the
     Duke of <span class="smcap">Bedford</span> at Woburn Abbey, when a general cropping, and
     combing out of hair powder took place: <span class="smcap">Lord W. Russell</span>, <span class="smcap">Lord
     Villiers</span>, <span class="smcap">Lord Paget</span>, &amp;c., &amp;c. They entered into an engagement to
     forfeit a sum of money if any of them wore their hair tied, or
     powdered, within a certain period. Many Noblemen and Gentlemen in
     the county of Bedford have since followed the example: it has
     become general with the Gentry in Hampshire, and the Ladies have
     left off wearing powder."&mdash;(<cite>Times, Sept. 25, 1795.</cite>)</p>

     <p>"<span class="smcap">The Bedford Crops.</span>&mdash;Something has at last fallen from this party
     to entertain the Public. We hope they will find their heads

     that more than one of them ought to have been <em>shaved</em>. If the
     <em>Shavees</em> think by publishing their names they will gain
     proselytes, till their absurdity is lost in the crowd, they are
     mistaken. Can it be supposed that a few drunken persons in a
     frolic, will be followed by the sober part of the people of
     England?</p>

     <p>"The new Crop is called the <em>Bedford Level</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page62" name="page62"></a>(p. 62)</span> We get a curious insight into the manners of the young men of
that day, in the following cutting from the <cite>Times, Dec. 14, 1795</cite>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"If the young men of the present day have not much wit in their
     heads, they have it at least in their <em>hats</em>. Amongst the
     pleasantries we have seen in this way, are the following: 'Not
     yours.'&mdash;'Hands off'&mdash;'No vermin'&mdash;and 'Rip this as you would a
     hot potato'&mdash;and other charming sallies of <em>refined</em> and
     <em>elegant</em> vivacity. But the wittiest linings are the political
     ones: Upon a table, the other day we observed one perfectly
     clean, in which was written '<cite>Avaunt, Guinea Pig!</cite>' and on the
     lining, in a very powdery hat, that lay in a window in the same
     room, were inscribed the two following monosyllables, '<cite>Off
     Crop</cite>.'"</p>

     <p>"A <span class="smcap">Crop</span>, who had begun to let his hair grow, was accused of
     aristocracy, and had his head shaved in the form of a horse-shoe
     at Wooburn, by a verdict of his <span class="smcap">Peers</span>."&mdash;(<cite>Times, Dec. 30,
     1795.</cite>)</p>

<p>Clothes were dear in those days, as the following Tailor's bill

double what it is now:&mdash;</p>

<p>Among the eccentricities of Costume, was a Coat devised by the then
Earl Spencer. He made a bet that he would cut off the tails of the
coat which he then wore, and appear in public in a jacket, which,
within a week, should be the fashion. He did so, and won his bet.
Gillray caricatured the Earl, in a picture 17th May, 1792. Earl
Spencer wears (in the picture) a blue spencer red coat with brass
buttons, yellow trousers, and blue and white stockings. The
"Threadpaper" has a green coat and grey stockings. Both have plenty of
powder on the backs of their coats.</p>

<p>The fashion is alluded to in a paragraph in the <cite>Times</cite> of 16th May
1795, and the "livery" therein alluded to is a covert satire on the
"Windsor Uniform," which has been the semi-court dress, from George
III.'s time to our own. It is said to have been taken from the uniform
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page64" name="page64"></a>(p. 64)</span> of a Berkshire Volunteer Cavalry Regiment, of which the King
was Colonel:&mdash;</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"The general fashion of wearing <em>Spencers</em>, reminds us of a wager
     laid by Lord <em>March</em>, who betted several years ago a considerable
     sum with some of his friends, that he would be able to introduce
     to general imitation, the most humiliating fashion he could think
     of. Accordingly he appeared several days successively about the
     Royal Exchange, dressed like a livery servant. The livery
     consisted of a blue coat, with crimson collar and cuffs; and he
     gained the wager."&mdash;(<cite>Times, May 16, 1795.</cite>)</p>

<p>The accompanying illustration by W. Hanlon (11th July 1795) is, of

dress, in which the "Crops" indulged.</p>

<p>These peculiar garments were called "Jean Debry," after the French
statesman of that name, who was born in 1760, died 1834. He was a
somewhat prominent figure in the French Revolution, and, as his name
was at this time much in men's mouths, he was made the peg on which to
hang a coat.&mdash;"A French Taylor fitting John Bull with a Jean de Bry,"
is by Gillray, 18th November 1799, and, although a gross Caricature,
fairly represents the garment. The tailor is in ecstasy with the fit.
"Aha! dere my friend, I fit you to de life! dere is Liberté! no tight
Aristocrat Sleeves, to keep from you vat you like! a ha! begar, dere,
he only want von leetle National Cockade to make look quite a la mode

<p>John Bull surveys himself in the looking-glass, grumbling at his
change of costume. "Liberty! quotha! why, zounds, I can't move my arms
at all! for all it looks woundy big! Oh! damn your French Alamodes,

     <p>"The <em>Long-toed Shoe</em> which now figures in Bond Street was
     regulated by an Act of Parliament so long ago as the reign of
     Edward III. No person under the rank of a Knight then had a right
     to advance his toe more than four inches beyond the natural
     extremity.... If ever, in some centuries to come, the little hat,
     stuffed coat, and long-toed shoe of a modern fine Gentleman
     should be discovered in some Museum of Antiquities, or to survive
     upon the Stage, they would no doubt give birth to many learned
     doubts and extraordinary speculations. By the size of a pair of
     modern <em>Leather Breeches</em>, it will naturally be inferred that the
     present race of men were of a Colossal form. When we suppose in
     the same collection a pair of our Hussar Boots to have escaped
     the ravage of time, will not our descendants enquire by what
     descending scale of rapid decay and diminution mankind is
     hastening into the pigmy state, or the dwarf? Our Coats too, in
     which the Cotton, the Wool, the Tow, and all the <i lang="la">et cetera</i> of
     quilting, which now form one half of our bulk, will then only
     seem the remains of the art of the virtuoso: and the curious
     stuffing he has devised to represent the gigantic proportions of
     the wearer. It ought, however, to be known, for the honour of
     this commercial nation, that it is to the spirit of justice and
     liberality of our tradesmen, that this extraordinary augmentation
     of our bulk is to be attributed. Having doubled the price of
     every article upon us, they have very fairly given us double
     measure, both in our Coats, Boots, and Breeches. The Hatter, I am
     sorry to say, is not entitled to the same commendation, for he
     has of late years perpetually diminished <span class="pagenum"><a id="page68" name="page68"></a>(p. 68)</span> and
     circumscribed the little brim he allows us, in the exact
     proportion that he has advanced the price of it, so that the
     scarcity of felt is like that of bread, the less you have, the
     more you are to pay for it. I paid a guinea and a quarter for the
     last I bought, and I was ingenuously told that by the time a hat
     cost two guineas, it would exactly be the size and the weight of
     one. All these tradesmen, in a fairer sense than the <em>hatters</em>,
     make the <em>most</em> of their customers: but he to whom the nobler
     part of man, the head, is committed, diminishes in the most
     scandalous manner the protection it requires...."&mdash;(<cite>Times, Sept.

<h2><span class="pagenum"><a id="page69" name="page69"></a>(p. 69)</span> WOMEN'S DRESS.</h2>

<p>The earliest Lady's fashion book I can find in the British Museum, is
"The Lady's Monthly Museum," &amp;c. "By a Society of Ladies,"&mdash;and it was
published in 1799&mdash;or just the last year of which this book takes
cognizance. But, luckily, the satirical prints supply the want, in a
great measure, although they are somewhat exaggerated. From them we
are able to see pictorially what might be hard to describe, and may be
perfectly certain that they represent "the very last thing out" at
their date of Publication. If, then, we have very little written about
female attire, in 1788, and the next year, or two, we must be content
with viewing the <i lang="la">veræ effigies</i> of the belles of that time.</p>

<p>Brighton, of course, was the fashionable watering-place, for there
were the life and gaiety of the young Court, in contradistinction to
the humdrum existence led by the King, Queen, and younger branches of
the Royal Family, at Weymouth. So it will be interesting to know their
habits at this famous sea-side resort. The <cite>Morning Post</cite>, 18th
September 1788, has the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"The <span class="smcap">Ladies</span> have no particular dress for the morning, but
     <em>huddle</em> away to the bathing place, in close caps, and <em>gipsey
     bonnets</em>, so that they look like a set of wandering
     <em>fortune-tellers</em>, who have just had the opportunity of pillaging
     the contents of a <em>frippery warehouse</em>, with which they had
     bedecked themselves in haste.</p>

     <p>"It is to be remarked that the ladies do not atone for the
     negligence of the morning, by neatness, and elegance, during the
     rest of the day, but <em>shuffle on something</em> by dinner time,
     <span class="pagenum"><a id="page70" name="page70"></a>(p. 70)</span> covering themselves with an enormous <em>nondescript</em>
     bonnet, which, to the confusion of all order, they afterwards
     think a proper garb for the Assembly."</p>
</div>

<p>In doors, the dresses were not so <em lang="fr">outré</em>, as we see by the two
illustrations taken from "The School for Scandal," 1st August 1788.</p>

<p>That ladies copied the eccentricities of male attire, and made them
their own, we have proof in this cutting from the <cite>Morning Post</cite>, 15th
January 1789:&mdash;</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"Among other fashions lately introduced from Paris is the brace
     of gold watch chains now sported by our fashionable females. Some
     economical husbands may wish their wives were less imitative."</p>
</div>

<p>The portrait of the Duchess of York (the Princess Frederique,
Charlotte, Ulrique, Catherine, of Prussia, married to the Duke,
November 1791), shews us the indoor dress of a lady of rank in 1792.
She had a remarkably small foot, and many were the delineations of her
shoes&mdash;actual size, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Of all curious freaks of fashion the following is the most
incomprehensible, yet it doubtless obtained:&mdash;</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"The fashion of dressing, at present, is to appear <em>prominent</em>,
     and the stays are made accordingly. This is holding out a wish to
     be thought in a thriving way, even without the authority of the
     <i>Arches Court</i> of Canterbury&mdash;something in the French way&mdash;a
     philosophical desire to be <em>conspicuously great</em> with <span class="smcap">MISCHIEF</span>,
     without any regard to law or reason. The idea was at first sent
     forward by a few <em>dropsical</em> Ladies."&mdash;(<cite>Times, March 25, 1793.</cite>)</p>

     <p class="p2">"The <em>Wapping Land-ladies</em> are all at the very pinnacle of the
     fashion. Nature has given them prominences which far out-picture
     the false mountains at the West end of the town. It is not only
     the fashion of appearing six months gone, that prevails with the
     ladies&mdash;but that of not having any waists, so that, even with
     their prominences, they may be called&mdash;<em>No-body</em>." (<cite>Times, April
     15, 1793.</cite>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page71" name="page71"></a>(p. 71)</span> A series of prints were published which represent the amount
of indebtedness, ladies were under, to Art, to repair the ravages made
by Nature.</p>

<p>No. 1 shows us most graphically the "levée au matin."&mdash;Tears drop from
the eyeless socket&mdash;a yawn discloses the want of teeth, and, the
handkerchief, tied round the head, which does service for a night cap,
tells a sad tale of baldness.</p>

<p>In No. 2 the defect of nature is being remedied by the insertion of a
glass eye&mdash;which the subsequent illustrations prove to be very
effective.</p>

<p>No. 3 shows the triumph of the hairdresser's art; and, certainly, it
adds much to the ladies personal attractions.</p>

<p>In No. 4 false teeth are being inserted, to replace those, of which
unkind nature has robbed her.</p>

<p>No. 5 applies the bloom of youth to the faded cheek,&mdash;a bloom that
never yet deceived any one.</p>

<p>In No. 6 the Belle has finished her toilette, and is now prepared to
break all hearts.</p>

<p>This series is attributed to Rowlandson&mdash;and, most probably, is his
work. It is called "Six Stages of making a face.&mdash;Dedicated with
respect to Lady Archer," of which lady we shall hear more anon under
the head of "Gaming."</p>

<p>Waists, as may have been perceived by the last two, or three
examples, have been gradually disappearing, until, as in "The
Scarecrow," they became practically <em>nil</em>. High feathers were
beginning to come in, and, in addition to the "panache," was worn a
curious thing made of straw, very much resembling the "bristle plume"
which used to be worn in the Shakos of our Engineers, and Artillery.
In imitation of the men, the ladies' throats were swathed in
voluminous wrappers.</p>

<p>With very low bodices, and very high waists, came very <span class="pagenum"><a id="page72" name="page72"></a>(p. 72)</span> scanty
clothing, with an absence of petticoat, a fashion which left very
little of the form to the imagination. I do not say that our English
Belles went to the extent of some of their French sisters, of having
their muslin dresses put on damp&mdash;and holding them tight to their
figures till they dried&mdash;so as absolutely to mould them to their form,
or that they ever discarded stockings, and went to balls with bare
feet, and only wearing sandals, having on but the lightest of
classical clothing&mdash;but their clothes were of the scantiest, and we
shall find that, as year succeeded year, this fashion developed, if
one can call diminution of clothing, development. Men made fun of it,
<em>vide</em> the following from the <cite>Times</cite>, 12th August, 1794:&mdash;"Amongst
prudent papas, the favourite toast at this time is 'The present
fashion of our wives and daughters,' viz. <em>No Waste</em>."</p>

<p>There was a very pretty song, called "Shepherds, I have lost my love,
Have you seen my Anna?"&mdash;and this was parodied as follows&mdash;the music
being the same as the original song:&mdash;</p>

<a id="imgsong" name="imgsong"></a>

<p class="p1">That a fashion may become one person, and not another, is peculiarly
exemplified by the two following pictures by Gillray, 9th December,
1794, both called "Following the Fashion:"&mdash;</p>

<table class="p1" summary="Fashion">
<tr>
<td class="bor_right_yes">
  "St. James's giving the Ton,<br />
   a Soul without a Body.</td>
<td class="bor_left_no">"Cheapside aping the Mode,<br />

</table>

<p class="p2">The tax on Hair powder was much objected to; people had been used,
for a long time, to grease, and powder their hair and wigs; and, when
the duty of a Guinea per head was passed, many left off using it. The
illustration "Leaving off Powder, or a Frugal family saving a
Guinea," was doubtless the fact in many a family. The man, in the
coloured engraving, with his "crop," to our eyes does not look so
singular, as the lady, with her "fausse chevelure" unpowdered looks so
bad, that, no wonder, ladies reverted to their own locks, as we see
in future illustrations. So also shall we see the "Cap" of the
period, the length of which is most amusingly portrayed.</p>

<p>The wearing of false hair is of very early origin, inasmuch as we
possess, in the British Museum, an early Egyptian wig, and, in every
age, we find women supplementing their natural attractions, by the
addition of some one else's hair. Here is a Hair-dresser's
advertisement of 1795, wherein is not only mentioned the price, &amp;c.,
of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page74" name="page74"></a>(p. 74)</span> hair, but shows the antiquity of the "Chignon," which,
otherwise, many might think of modern date.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"TO THE LADIES.&mdash;T. BOWMAN respectfully acquaints the Ladies,
     that he has entirely removed his Shop and Manufactory to No. 102
     New Bond Street, near Brook Street. Firmly relying upon the
     future favors and recommendation of his old Customers, and
     trusting to the superiority of his articles, he has augmented his
     stock of Chignons or Braids, from 600 to near 1000, in 14 shades
     (not 20) of brown colours, besides Auburns, Flaxens, &amp;c., and in
     8 lengths (not 50) at 10s., 14s., £1 £1 1s., £1 11s. 6d., £2 2s.,
     £3 3s., £4 4s., and £6 6s. each. Any colour matched in all the
     sizes in a minute. T. Bowman formerly gave a description of his
     Braids, but that has been copied by another and applied unto his
     own, without their possessing one requisite for which Bowman's
     Braids have been distinguished: and, not contented with slaying
     by twenties, he now kills by fifties. Bravo! Captain Boabdill,
     fifty more, kill them!!! As for the shades, what with Chinese
     hairs, mixing, and dying, he may have them (as he says) of every
     tint, but for real, natural, Brown colours. T. Bowman, with by
     far the greatest stock in the Kingdom, cannot make more than 14
     shades; he can only challenge a comparison, and pledges himself
     to make good every assertion he has at any time made. His
     Brunswick fillets, an entire new and elegant article, with curls
     complete, fit either for morning or full dress, from 7s. 6d. to
     10s. 6d. each, with Tetes, Borders, and every article in
     ornamental Hair, much cheaper than at any shop in town: having a
     very large stock, and dealing for ready money only, he has as yet
     made no advance on his old prices, although the price of hair is
     now double. Country orders, with money, or reference, duly
     observed. Chignons, &amp;c., changed when not approved of, if not
     powdered."&mdash;(<cite>Times, June 22, 1795.</cite>)</p>

     <p>"At all elegant Assemblies, there is a room set apart for the
     lady visitants to put their feathers on, as it is impossible to
     wear them in any carriage with a top to it. The lustres are also
     removed upon this account, and the doors are carried up to the
     height of the ceiling. A well-dressed Lady, who nods with
     dexterity, can give a friend a little tap upon the shoulder
     across the room, without incommoding the dancers. The Ladies'

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page76" name="page76"></a>(p. 76)</span> The freaks of fashion, towards the latter end of 1795, are
most curious. "Waggoner's frocks," and the "Petticoat" dress, are
singular illustrations of feminine taste. This latter is noticed in a
paragraph in the <cite>Times</cite>, 27th Oct. 1795. "The present fashionable

uncovered bosom so attracts the candle snuffer, is intended to
represent Lady Georgiana Gordon, afterwards Duchess of Bedford.</p>

<p>"High Change in Bond Street" is by Gillray (27th March 1796), and is a
most amusing caricature of the then prevalent fashions both of men and
women. The "Bond Street Loungers," are depicted to perfection.</p>

     at each side in drapery, so that both thighs could be seen; the
     binding of the petticoat was tied round the neck, and her arms
     were through the pocket holes. Her head dress was a man's pearl
     coloured stocking, the foot hanging down at the back of the head
     like a lappet, and in the heel of the stocking was stuck a large
     diamond pin, the <em lang="fr">tout ensemble</em> not less novel, than

<h2><span class="pagenum"><a id="page80" name="page80"></a>(p. 80)</span> NAVY AND ARMY.</h2>

<p>No history of England, that I know of, has ever given us so graphic a
description of the ways and means for procuring men for the Navy, as
the Newspapers of the time, and in this, as in many other things,
their help is invaluable.</p>

<p>When we find from what classes the Navy was recruited, we wonder at
what the men went through, without much murmuring; and, if their very
moderate, and just, demands, had been met in a conciliatory spirit, or
even, officially investigated, instead of being pooh-poohed, and
shelved&mdash;there would have been no mutiny at the Nore, nor elsewhere.</p>

<p>When afloat, sailors were kept in subjection, or as it was termed,
discipline, by brutality, foul language, and a plentiful application
of the lash, to be recouped by almost unlimited license, whilst on
shore, or, for the matter of that, when afloat, if at home in harbour.
When the <i>Royal George</i> went down, there were 200 women on board, and
in Dibdin's song of "Wapping Old Stairs," the heroine plaintively
reminds her temporary lover thus&mdash;</p>

<p class="p1 poem">
  "When <em>I passed a whole fortnight between decks with you</em>,<br />
  Did I e'er give a kiss, Tom, to one of the Crew?"</p>

<p class="p1">When the War with France broke out, it was hardly to be imagined that
Fishermen, and Merchant seamen, would <span class="pagenum"><a id="page81" name="page81"></a>(p. 81)</span> volunteer to leave their
quiet occupation, to be bullied by petty, and other officers; to be
triced up, and lashed unmercifully, for even a venial fault; to be no
better paid, nor fed than they were already; and to have an extra
chance of death in a Naval engagement, even if the English were
victorious, or the certainty of semi-starvation in a French prison, if
captured. So the State, wanting food for slaughter, stretched out its
strong hand, and took it, by means of the pressgang. I shall have to
recount a long list of "severe," or "hot," presses&mdash;and, first of all,
in order that we may perfectly understand what a "press" was, and so
thoroughly identify ourselves with the position, let us see the very
minute, and vivid, description of <i>Smollett</i>, in "Roderick Random."</p>

<p>"As I crossed Tower Wharf, a squat, tawny fellow, with a hanger by his
side, and a cudgel in his hand, came up to me calling, 'Yo ho!
brother, you must come along with me.' As I did not like his
appearance, instead of answering his salutation, I quickened my pace,
in hopes of ridding myself of his company; upon which, he whistled
aloud, and immediately another sailor appeared before me, who laid
hold of me by the collar, and began to drag me along. Not being of a
humour to relish such treatment, I disengaged myself of the assailant,
and, with one blow of my cudgel, laid him motionless on the ground;
and, perceiving myself surrounded in a trice, by ten or a dozen more,
exerted myself with such dexterity and success, that some of my
opponents were fain to attack me with drawn Cutlasses; and, after an
obstinate engagement, in which I received a large wound on my head,
and another on my left cheek, I was disarmed, taken prisoner, and
carried on board a pressing tender; where, after being pinioned like a
malefactor, I <span class="pagenum"><a id="page82" name="page82"></a>(p. 82)</span> was thrust down into the hold, among a parcel of
miserable wretches, the sight of whom well nigh distracted me.</p>

<p>"As the commanding officer had not humanity enough to order my wounds
to be dressed, and I could not use my own hands, I desired one of my
fellow-captives who was unfettered, to take a handkerchief out of my
pocket, and tie it round my head, to stop the bleeding. He pulled out
my handkerchief ('tis true), but, instead of applying it to the use
for which I designed it, went to the grating of the hatchway, and,
with astonishing composure, sold it before my face to a bum boat
woman, then on board, for a quart of gin, with which he treated my
companions, regardless of my circumstances, and entreaties.</p>

<p>"I complained bitterly of this robbery, to the midshipman on deck,
telling him, at the same time, that, unless my wounds were dressed, I
should bleed to death. But compassion was a weakness of which no man
could justly accuse this person, who squirted a mouthful of dissolved
tobacco upon me through the gratings, told me 'I was a mutinous dog,
and that I might die, and be damned.' Finding there was no other
remedy, I appealed to patience, and laid up this usage in my memory,
to be recalled at a fitter season. In the meantime, loss of blood,
vexation, and want of food, contributed, with the noisome stench of
the place, to throw me into a swoon; out of which I was recovered by
the tar who stood centinel over us, who at the same time regaled me
with a draught of flip, and comforted me with the hopes of being put
on board the <i>Thunder</i> next day, where I should be freed of my
handcuffs, and cured of my wounds by the doctor."</p>

<p>The following instructive little story will shew how mutinies were
made:&mdash;</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"The mutiny which existed several days on board the 'Culloden' of
     74 guns, and which, it is said, originated in the wish of the
     crew to have the ship docked, previous to her sailing for the
     West Indies, was, on Wednesday, settled by an order from the
     Admiralty in the following manner:&mdash;'That several Captains were
     to go on board and inform the crew, unless they immediately
     returned to their duty, the "Royal George" of 110 guns, and
     "Queen," of 98 guns, would directly be laid alongside them.' They
     were allowed half an hour to consider the matter. The officers,
     and others, who chose to leave the ship, were at liberty so to
     do. The ship's company several times wanted to make terms, which
     could not possibly be complied with: in about twenty minutes they
     all agreed to return to their duty; 12 of the ringleaders were
     instantly seized, and put in irons, and will no doubt be tried by
     a Court Martial for the same. During the time the ship was in
     this mutinous state, the crew flogged several marines because
     they <span class="pagenum"><a id="page86" name="page86"></a>(p. 86)</span> would not join them, and would have punished the
     whole, had they gone below."&mdash;(<cite>Times, Dec. 13, 1794.</cite>)</p>

     <p class="p2">"The cause of the mutiny, on board the 'Culloden,' was briefly
     this. In coming into Spithead, the 'Sampson,' and 'Culloden,'
     both run a-ground. The former was a good deal damaged: the latter
     lost only her rudder, which could easily be repaired at Spithead,
     but the 'Sampson' was obliged to be carried into dock. Some of
     the seamen of the 'Culloden,' in a mutinous manner, expressed
     their doubts of the safety of the ship: and, upon being
     remonstrated with, insisted upon going into harbour."&mdash;(<cite>Times,
     Dec. 16, 1794.</cite>)</p>
</div>

<p>Which were right, the Sailors, or the Admiralty?</p>

<p>Here is a curious case, which shows the want of men to man the fleet,
and how unscrupulously even magistrates lent themselves against all
justice, and equity, in helping to kidnap men for the use of the Navy
Services:&mdash;</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"PUBLIC OFFICE, BOW STREET.&mdash;A master bricklayer, of the name of
     <span class="smcap">Whitehead</span>, brought his apprentice before the sitting magistrate,
     on a charge of having stolen a scaffolding board, value under
     <em>ninepence</em>: he had his choice, either to enlist as a soldier, or
     to be sent on board the fleet: to both of which he objected. The
     Magistrate then ordered a letter to be written to the Regulating
     Captain, Tower Hill, to have him sent on board the
     Navy."&mdash;(<cite>Times, Jan. 5, 1795.</cite>)</p>
</div>

<p>On this, one of the spectators addressed Mr. <span class="smcap">Bond</span>, and told him he was
acting improperly.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"Who are you?" says Mr. B&mdash;&mdash;. "I am a Mr. <span class="smcap">Thompson</span>, a Member of
     the House of Commons for Evesham: and I tell you that you act
     illegally." "Do you tell me, sitting here as a magistrate, that I
     act illegally?" "I do: for the boy has committed a crime, he is
     not to be punished by you, or any other justice: it is to the
     laws of the land, and to them alone, that he is amenable: and I
     say, that it <span class="pagenum"><a id="page87" name="page87"></a>(p. 87)</span> is a violation of the liberty of the
     subject." Mr. <span class="smcap">Bond</span> observed, that the <span class="smcap">King</span> wanted men: and did
     not Mr. <span class="smcap">Thompson</span> think that it was proper to procure those for
     him, who had forfeited their liberty? Mr. T. replied, that he
     knew that the <span class="smcap">King</span> <em>did</em> want men, but that that was a very
     improper mode of coming at them. Mr. <span class="smcap">Bond</span> then observed, that
     probably Mr. T. might investigate it in the House of Commons: but
     whether he did or did not, he should act as he thought proper for
     that time. He then sent for Major Leeson, and had him enlisted.
     Mr. <span class="smcap">Thompson</span> signified as much to him, as that it should be
     brought before the House."</p>
</div>

<p>(On Monday, 5th Jan., the matter was introduced in a speech of Mr.
Thompson's, on the Habeas Corpus Bill, but nothing was done.)</p>

<p>Jack did, occasionally, get some prize money, but nothing ever came up
to the "Hermione" in 1762, when each ordinary seaman had about £800
for his share; but when we look at the disparity between the Captain's
and Sailor's share, we can enter into the spirit of the Sailor's
prayer, before an engagement, that the shots might be apportioned,
like the prize money,&mdash;the greater part among the officers.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"By the determination of the <span class="smcap">Lord Chancellor</span> in favour of the
     captors of the <i>St. Jago</i> Register ship, Admiral <span class="smcap">Gell</span> will get,

<p class="p2 date">"<span class="smcap">Antigua</span>, <cite>January 23, 1798</cite>.</p>

     <p>"On the 13th inst. died, at English Harbour, Charles Peterson,
     Esq., first Lieutenant of H.M. ship <i>Perdrix</i>. This event was
     occasioned by a dispute between the deceased, and Lord Camelford,
     upon the right of commanding at English Harbour. Lord Camelford
     commanded H.M. sloop-of-war the <i>Favourite</i>, by virtue of an
     order, or warrant, from Admiral Harvey; and Mr. Peterson, though
     an older Lieutenant than Lord Camelford, had lately served on
     board that ship under his command, but, having been removed to
     the <i>Perdrix</i>, and Lord Camelford not having a commission as
     Master, and Commander, Mr. Peterson, being then at English
     Harbour, supposed himself to be the Commanding Officer, and,
     under that idea, issued some orders to Lord Camelford, which were
     answered by other orders from Lord C. to Mr. P. Upon Mr.
     Peterson's refusal to obey these orders, a Lieutenant with a
     party of Marines were sent to put him under arrest, and Mr. P.
     prepared for resistance, and ordered the crew of the <i>Perdrix</i> to
     arm in his defence. But, before any conflict took place, Lord
     Camelford arrived, went up to Mr. P., demanded if he would obey
     his orders, or not, and, upon being answered in the negative, he
     immediately shot him dead upon the spot. An inquest was taken by
     the Coroner, the next day; but the Jury, not being willing to
     take upon themselves the determination of the question upon whom
     the command at English Harbour had devolved, found only that the
     deceased had been shot by Lord Camelford, in consequence of a
     mutiny."&mdash;(<cite>Times, April 11, 1798.</cite>)</p>

     <p>"Lord Camelford appears to me to be a new character in his
     <em>Class</em>. He is very severe in carrying on duty; seldom ties up a

     punishment in this country than what is produced by giving the
     same number in a northern climate.</p>

     of no swabs (gold shoulder knots), but still appears in a

     <em>all the hair is shaved off his head</em>, on which he wears a
     monstrous large <em>Gold-laced cocked-hat</em>. He is dressed in a
     Lieutenant's plain coat, the buttons of which are as green with

     <p>"Our countrymen who have been employed at Revel, in conducting the
     embarkation of the Russian troops, have been honoured with great
     marks of attention from the Emperor, and his Family.</p>

     <p>"His Imperial Majesty requested the <i>Nile</i> lugger, in which
     Captain Popham went to Petersburgh, to be brought up close to his
     palace at Peterhoff, where he went on board, accompanied by only
     one Nobleman. The lugger was immediately got under weigh, and,
     there being a fine breeze of wind, His Majesty was highly
     surprised, and gratified, at the swiftness of her sailings. After
     a two hour's cruise, he was landed again at the palace, when the
     lugger gave him a royal salute.</p>

     <p>"It appears the account he gave of the English vessel had greatly
     excited the curiosity of the rest of the Royal Family, as, next
     day, Captain Popham was honoured with the company of the Empress,
     the Emperor, Four Princesses, and Three Princes, with their
     retinue, when they were, of course, treated with a sail, at which
     they were highly delighted, and, with great condescension,
     partook of some ship beef, and biscuit. The Emperor was
     particularly attentive to everything on board <span class="pagenum"><a id="page94" name="page94"></a>(p. 94)</span> the lugger,
     visiting every part of her, and, when the sailors were hoisting
     the sails, he insisted on helping for once, to set the sails of a
     vessel belonging to his gracious Ally, and actually hauled the
     rope with the men. The Empress begged that the crew would sing
     'God save the King,' which was instantly complied with, to Her
     Majesty's entire satisfaction.</p>

     <p>"Captain Popham was presented by the Emperor, with an elegant
     snuff-box set with diamonds, and with a valuable ring from Her
     Imperial Majesty. His Majesty has likewise knighted Captain
     Popham, conferring on him the Order of St. John of Jerusalem.
     Lieutenant Pratt, Captain Popham's Assistant in this business,
     has also been presented with a gold snuff-box, from the Emperor,

     <p>"There is at present in the Middlesex Hospital, a young, and

     singular:&mdash;At an early period of her life, having been deprived
     by the villany of a trustee, of a sum of money bequeathed her by
     a deceased relation of high rank, she followed the fortunes of a
     young Naval officer, to whom she was attached, and personated a
     common sailor before the mast, during a cruise in the North Seas.
     In consequence of a lover's quarrel, she quitted the ship and
     assumed for a time the military character: but her passion for
     the sea prevailing, she returned to her favourite element, did
     good service, and received a severe wound, on board Earl St.
     Vincent's ship, on the glorious 14th of February, and again bled
     in the cause of her country, in the engagement off Camperdown. On
     this last occasion her knee was shattered, and an amputation is
     likely to ensue. This spirited female, we understand, receives a

     <p class="p2">"An extraordinary circumstance lately happened to a sheriff's
     officer, in the neighbourhood of Covent Garden. Hot with <em>juniper
     berry</em>, not the <em>Tuscan Grape</em>, he had an idea of beating the
     <em>Carmagnols</em>; and in consequence, going to a recruiting party in
     Bow Street, said he would <em>enlist</em>. The Captain of the party gave
     him a shilling, in the usual phrase of <em>His Majesty's name</em>:&mdash;he
     said he must have more:&mdash;a guinea was given him in His Majesty's
     name, to serve so and so; he <span class="pagenum"><a id="page98" name="page98"></a>(p. 98)</span> took it, and departed. The
     matter thus rested for five or six days, when he came back to
     return the money, which he said he had taken <em>in a frolic</em>. The
     money was refused. He said he would be revenged, and, having a
     writ some days after, against one of the enlisted recruits, he
     went to the rendezvous house to execute it, where the Captain
     took him up as a <em>deserter</em>, and sent him to the <i>Savoy Prison</i>,
     from whence he has been released by a <i lang="la">Habeas Corpus</i>, contrary,
     as military men say, to the law by which the military are
     governed. This will occasion a most curious contest."&mdash;(<cite>Times,

     <p class="p2">"A melancholy accident happened yesterday, about one o'clock, at
     the Recruiting Office, Angel Court, Charing Cross. A sergeant
     having kidnapped a man, for the better securing him, had
     confined him in a back-garret at the top of the house, after he
     had cut off his hair, to disfigure him, and, tying his hands
     behind him, and locking the door, left him by himself. By some
     means, the man got his hands loosened, and chose rather to risk
     his life by jumping from the window, than suffer himself to be
     any longer in their clutches; accordingly, he attempted to pitch
     upon a leaded roof, which was about half way to the bottom, but,
     unfortunately, jumping short, he fell back, and his head falling
     against the wall, his skull was fractured in such a shocking
     manner, that he died in about an hour afterwards. The populace
     were so much enraged at this shocking enormity, which we are
     sorry to believe is too often repeated, that they almost
     demolished the Recruiting Office. The mob had increased to so
     great a degree at ten o'clock last night, that it was found
     necessary to call out a party of the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page99" name="page99"></a>(p. 99)</span> Horse Guards, for
     the protection of the neighbourhood."&mdash;(<cite>Times, Aug. 16, 1794.</cite>)</p>

</div>

<p>This was a serious riot. The mob at that time was peculiarly
excitable, and had a great deal more of its own way than it has now.
So a spark only was wanted to make a flame. This was found in a
rumoured case of kidnapping for the army; impressing for the navy
could be understood, because it had obtained from time immemorial,
that when the king wanted men to man his war vessels, he took seamen,
or fishermen, but this was something new, and must be put down,
otherwise no man was safe. The truth was not scrupulously adhered to,
and the print shops, ever eager to make money by pandering to the
passions of the hour, published exaggerated, and heartrending
pictures, of the way in which the army was recruited, and, altogether,
a very pretty riot was got up.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"On Saturday morning, early, a mob again collected before Angel
     Court, Charing Cross, and attacked the house from whence the
     unfortunate young man had thrown himself into the street. The
     populace proceeded to gut the house, throwing the furniture out
     of the windows. The street was covered with feathers from the
     beds which were torn to pieces: they were proceeding to demolish
     an adjoining house, when the military were called in, and several
     officer's detachments, both of horse, and foot, again paraded the
     streets at Charing Cross. The mob having assembled again
     yesterday morning, and becoming very riotous, a troop of Horse
     Guards was very properly ordered out, and two or three of the
     principal rioters about the King's Arms Public House, taken into
     custody.</p>

     <p>"It is some satisfaction that we have heard the <span class="smcap">Coroner's</span> report
     on the investigation of this unpleasant business. A most
     respectable jury sat five hours, on Saturday night, to consider
     of the verdict: and, after the most minute testimony of several
     witnesses, it was proved that the young man, whose <span class="pagenum"><a id="page100" name="page100"></a>(p. 100)</span> name
     was <i>Howe</i>, and lived at Wandsworth, was a <span class="smcap">Lunatic</span>, and had been
     several times confined by his friends. He had himself offered to
     enlist; no blame whatever attaches in this instance, to the
     people of the house. We trust that this impartial enquiry will
     satisfy the minds of every one, and that there will be no more
     mobs."&mdash;(<cite>Times, Aug. 18, 1794.</cite>)</p>

     <p class="p2">"In consequence of a mob again assembling at Charing Cross,
     yesterday evening, the Horse Guards were again called out, and
     paraded the streets till midnight."&mdash;(<cite>Times, Aug. 19, 1794.</cite>)</p>

     <p class="p2 center">"THE RIOTS IN LONDON.</p>

     <p>"We had flattered ourselves with the hope, that the very fair,
     and public, investigation which took place on the <span class="smcap">Coroner's
     Inquest</span>, which sat on Saturday last on the body of the
     unfortunate man, <span class="smcap">Howe</span>, who threw himself out of a window of a
     Recruiting House, would have satisfied every man's mind, that
     <span class="smcap">Howe</span> was a <span class="smcap">Lunatic</span>, and had been so for many years past: and that
     it was in a fit of Lunacy, that he destroyed himself. We hoped
     after this investigation, all kinds of mobs would have ceased.</p>

     <p>"We are sorry to observe, that the people are instigated to riot
     by the false representations daily made in those Jacobin prints,
     which are, at all times, so eager to announce, and magnify, every
     public misfortune. One of these yesterday asserted, 'that a poor
     woman with five children, and herself now pregnant, suspecting
     the crimps had decoyed her husband into a house in Whitcomb St.,
     watched it, and <em>by chance saw her husband chained to the
     floor</em>.' An evening paper of yesterday, observes 'that the
     guards, both horse and foot, were <em>as usual</em>, grossly insulting
     inoffensive passengers,' and it concludes with a piece of advice
     to these military gentlemen, 'that they are not always with
     musquets, and swords, in their hands, and that the people may be
     roused to resistance.' Now we know that no gentlemen could have
     observed greater caution than the military have done on this
     occasion: and the above remarks have no other object than to
     excite riot.</p>

     <p>"On Tuesday last, <i>John Kerr</i> and <i>John Ruggle</i>, were committed
     <span class="pagenum"><a id="page101" name="page101"></a>(p. 101)</span> to Newgate for stripping a man of his cloaths. Kerr is
     the man who keeps a house in Whitcomb Street, Charing Cross;
     which was assailed by a mob on Tuesday night, and very much
     damaged. It was owing to this riot, that the Horse Guards were
     again called out, and paraded the streets, through the night, as
     well as yesterday, to keep the peace.</p>

     <p>"Six of those who were found in Kerr's house throwing the
     furniture out of the windows, were taken into custody, and,
     yesterday morning, were all committed to Tothill-fields
     Bridewell.</p>

     <p>"A riot also was attempted to be raised at a recruiting-office in
     Tooley St., Southwark, on Tuesday night.</p>

     <p>"Yesterday, a mob assembled before a house of the same
     description, in Shoe Lane, at which several stones were thrown:
     and, at length, it became so serious, that the <span class="smcap">Lord Mayor</span> was
     called upon to interpose his assistance, and attended, and, by
     the interference of a few constables, the mob dispersed, but, in
     the evening, the number of people continuing to increase, a party
     of guards were sent from the Tower, and the Lord Mayor, at eight
     o'clock, read the Riot Act. The mob, after being driven out of
     Shoe Lane by the soldiers, rushed suddenly to Bride Lane, where
     they broke open a house which had been employed as a
     recruiting-office, and proceeded to throw the beds, and some
     little furniture that remained in it, out of the windows; but,
     hearing of the approach of the military, they fled, saying they
     had plenty more business to do. It was reported, at the time this
     paper was going to press, that the Recruiting Offices on Mutton
     Hill, and Cow-Cross, near Clerkenwell Green, had likewise met a
     similar fate."&mdash;(<cite>Times, Aug. 20, 1794.</cite>)</p>

     <p class="p2">"On Wednesday, the examinations closed respecting <i>Mrs. Hanna</i>,
     who kept the recruiting office at Charing Cross, when she was
     acquitted, no evidence being adduced to criminate her. This
     acquittal has been the consequence of a very scrutinizing
     investigation.</p>

     <p>"The riots were not confined, on Wednesday night, to Fleet St.
     and the neighbourhood, but extended to the Raven, in Golden Lane,
     and the Sash, in Moorfields, and very much damaged the Rum
     Puncheon, in Old St., and a private house <span class="pagenum"><a id="page102" name="page102"></a>(p. 102)</span> in Long Lane.
     They were all recruiting houses. A recruiting house, opposite
     Fetter Lane, in Holborn, was completely gutted.</p>

     <p>"Yesterday, bills were very properly stuck up in different parts
     of the town, to the following purport:&mdash;'You are earnestly
     requested to depart hence, and not by remaining, encourage others
     to stop, by which a crowd will be accumulated, and your personal
     liberty may be endangered.' Parents were likewise warned from
     suffering their children to appear abroad.</p>

     <p>"It is greatly to be apprehended that there exists a scheme to
     raise mobs, and disturb the peace of the metropolis. On Friday,
     and Saturday, during the riots at Charing Cross, great pains were
     taken to persuade the people, that there were subterraneous
     passages from the houses to the Thames, and that men were sent
     off in the night. On Monday, and Tuesday, hand-bills were
     distributed, telling the people that men, and children, were
     kidnapped, and sent off to Canada, and elsewhere. Nothing can be
     more notoriously false than such assertions."&mdash;(<cite>Times, Aug. 22,
     1794.</cite>)</p>

     <p class="p2">"On Thursday night there was an attempt made to raise a riot in
     St. George's Fields, at the Milk House, the corner of the London
     Road, the master of which is a temporary Serjeant to recruit for
     some of the volunteer corps; but by the spirited behaviour of the
     recruits, soldiers and light horse volunteers, in that quarter,
     the incendiaries did not proceed to acts of violence. It was
     evidently apparent that the mob was led on by persons above the
     common rank, whose sole aim is, if possible, under the idea of
     some pretended grievance, to raise a general riot in the
     metropolis. On Thursday, several persons were committed to the
     New Compter, by the Lord Mayor, for being concerned in the riot
     in Shoe Lane; and six men were committed to Newgate, from the
     Public Office, in Worship Street, for being concerned in the
     riots at the Sash, in Moorfields, and at the Black Raven, in
     Golden Lane.</p>

     <p>"In the course of the same day, several attempts of a similar
     nature were made in different quarters of the town, which were
     prevented, however, by the appearance of the regular military,
     and, in some places, by the City Horse <span class="pagenum"><a id="page103" name="page103"></a>(p. 103)</span> Volunteers, who
     have been out on duty every day. The recruiting offices in Drury
     Lane, and at Shoreditch, were attempted to be demolished. As the
     continuance of these riotous proceedings is of the most
     dangerous nature, we trust that some more decisive steps will be
     taken, by Government, for their suppression."&mdash;(<cite>Times, Aug. 23,
     1794.</cite>)</p>

     <p class="p2">"The activity of the Magistrates, and the arrival of the Oxford
     Blues, to assist the Civil Power, caused the mobs to be cautious
     of appearing on Saturday. They found that it was determined to
     fire upon them if they did not desist; and, therefore, they
     thought personal safety the best policy. A very rigid, and
     severe, investigation will, no doubt, be made into the practice
     of <em>crimping</em>, and a stop put to the disgraceful manner of
     <em>recruiting</em>."&mdash;(<cite>Times, Aug. 26, 1794.</cite>)</p>

     <p>"However expedient it is to recruit our Land Forces, and strongly
     as it is requisite to make our Navy respectable, and superior to
     the enemy, yet, in attaining these essential points, the
     constitutional liberty of the subject should be preserved. It is,
     therefore, with a degree of regret, we mention that the power of
     enlisting men for the Land Service, in particular, has been
     entrusted to persons who have abused the confidence reposed in
     them, and who have used the most unjustifiable means to
     accomplish their purposes. As an instance, among others that have
     previously been brought before the public, we are authorised,
     from the circumstances of the case, to state, that on Friday
     last, a very great mob assembled in <i>London Road</i>, leading from
     the Obelisk, in St. George's Fields, to the Elephant and Castle,
     at Newington Butts, and, having intimation that a number of men
     were there imprisoned by a certain description of <em>Crimps</em>, they
     attacked the house where these persons were confined, demolished
     the windows, and released eighteen men, who were chained together
     by hand-cuffs, and other iron ligaments.</p>

     <p>"The Borough Magistrates, on hearing of this outrage, immediately
     sent down their officers: and the <em>Acting Recruiting Serjeant</em>
     being taken into custody, he was, after a short examination,
     committed to the New Gaol. The circumstances which led to the
     discovery of this imprisonment, was, that of kidnapping a
     pot-boy, who, before he was chained down, contrived to break a
     pane of glass in the drawing-room window (for the house was a
     private one, and elegantly furnished), from whence he cried out
     'Murder!' This alarmed the neighbourhood, and, as it had been
     suspected by them, that persons were illegally confined there,
     the doors, and windows, were soon demolished, and the prisoners
     liberated. The Serjeant, and his crew, had two women of the town
     genteelly dressed up for the purpose of inveigling young men into
     the house, which they styled their lodgings, where the deluded
     were instantly hand-cuffed, and, about three or four o'clock, in
     the morning, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page105" name="page105"></a>(p. 105)</span> sent off in coaches, hired for the purpose,
     to the country. On Saturday, several more youths, who were
     confined in other parts of the Fields, were released by the
     Magistrates, amidst the plaudits of a numerous multitude of
     spectators."&mdash;(<cite>Times, Jan. 12, 1795.</cite>)</p>

     <p class="p2">"On Tuesday night some disturbance happened in Charles Streets,
     Westminster, occasioned by some crimps having inveigled a boy
     from his parents, and lodged him in a house there. The mob broke
     the windows of it, and the boy was rescued. We have every reason
     to hope that the most severe punishment will be inflicted on the
     crimps, Government having taken every possible pains to prevent
     such abuses."&mdash;(<cite>Times, April 16, 1795.</cite>)</p>

     <p class="p2">"Yesterday evening, about seven o'clock, a very considerable mob
     assembled about Charing Cross, and, under the pretence of
     delivering a man from the Crimping House, they attacked the
     house, which is up a little court near Northumberland House, and
     threw all the furniture out of the windows. Charing Cross was
     covered with feathers. The mob became so numerous, and
     disorderly, that it was found necessary to call in the assistance
     of the Horse Guards: and the <span class="smcap">Riot Act</span> was twice read by a
     Magistrate. The street was much thronged, and the tumult
     continued, when this Paper went to press: although there had been
     no other act of serious mischief. No one can detest the business
     of Crimping more than we do: but we have strong reasons to
     believe that this is very frequently made a stalking horse with
     the factious, to provoke a riot."&mdash;(<cite>Times, July 12, 1795.</cite>)</p>

     <p class="p2">"A Mob collected themselves again, last night, at Charing Cross,
     when, after making every one pull off their hats, as they passed,
     they proceeded to Mr. <span class="smcap">Pitt's</span>, in Downing St., and broke several
     windows in his house; but, the Guards being immediately called
     out, and appearing in sight, very soon dispersed them.</p>

     <p>"The Mob, afterwards, went over Westminster Bridge, and paraded
     to St. George's-fields, where they attacked the <i>Royal George</i>
     Public-house, near the Obelisk, and threw all the furniture of it
     into the road, and there burnt it. They gutted <span class="pagenum"><a id="page106" name="page106"></a>(p. 106)</span> another
     Recruiting house, in Lambeth-Road, and, afterwards, made a
     bonfire of the furniture. This was mistaken by many, to be houses
     on fire. There were some of the Mob who kept watch on the outside
     of the houses, to give notice of the arrival of the military, who
     did not come till after the furniture of these two houses were
     consumed. The Mob compelled the inhabitants of the houses in the
     neighbourhood, to put up lights.</p>

     <p>"The Riot at Charing Cross, on Sunday night, was begun by a very
     few persons who wished for mischief, and called out the words,
     <span class="smcap">Crimps</span>, and <span class="smcap">Kidnappers</span>! The damage was done almost
     instantaneously, and the villains escaped, leaving a numerous
     assembly of people, who were only drawn together by an idle
     curiosity, on the Surrey-road, near the Circus. Yesterday
     morning, however, about seven o'clock, it was assailed by a mob,
     and, notwithstanding it was well defended, and that the door was
     plated with iron, it was forced, and the prisoners rescued. Last
     night the mob again assembled about half past eight o'clock, near
     the Obelisk, in St. George's fields, where they gutted another
     Recruiting Office, and threw the furniture into the road, of
     which they made a bonfire. At first, the mob consisted only of
     about one hundred men, but the flames soon attracted great
     numbers. About nine, the Horse Guards arrived, and soon dispersed
     the crowd. We wish they had come sooner, as it is extremely
     injudicious to the public interest, that such indecent sights
     should be repeated. It was very well known that a Mob meant to
     assemble, and, of course, the Military should have been at hand,
     to meet it. Several persons were much hurt, in not being able to
     disperse soon enough, which ought to be a warning not to mingle
     in such a crowd. The Duchess of <span class="smcap">Gloucester</span>, who was at the
     Circus, with her daughter, was escorted home by a party of
     horse."&mdash;(<cite>Times, July 14, 1795.</cite>)</p>

     <p class="p2">"The <span class="smcap">Riots</span> continued on Monday evening in St. George's Fields,

<p>The way in which the patronage in the Army was <span class="pagenum"><a id="page107" name="page107"></a>(p. 107)</span> managed, was a
crying shame&mdash;children in their cradles had Cornetcies presented to
them, and their promotion went on several steps before they left
school. We hear of the natural consequence, in the following extract
from the <cite>Times, 4th Jan. 1794</cite>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"We are extremely sorry that our public duty should call upon us
     to make any unpleasant remarks on the officers of our Army
     abroad, but repeated letters from the Continent, received by all
     descriptions of persons, agree in saying that there is a great
     want of Subordination among our troops. We shall not enter into
     particulars on this subject, as our only object is, that this
     observation should meet the eye of the Commander-in-Chief, and
     other General Officers, and that they should take the matter into
     their serious consideration. The evil is certainly increased by
     having so many young men introduced into the Army, and placing
     them over the heads of veteran Soldiers."</p>

     <p class="p2">"The scandalous abuses which have been so often, and so justly,
     complained of, as detrimental to the public service, of children
     being taken from school, and appointed Officers, cannot be too
     soon remedied, though it will be a Herculean task to cleanse the
     Augean stable. In mentioning the following circumstance, we have
     certainly no kind of ill-will towards the party concerned; but it
     is a fact, that a child, <em>not fourteen years of age</em>, is now
     under orders for embarkation at Plymouth, who has been taken from
     school, to join his regiment at <i>St. Domingo</i>, as <span class="smcap">Captain</span>!!! It
     is impossible for any man, who has the interest of his country at
     heart, to hear of such abuses without commenting on them with the
     utmost severity. The fault is not with Government, but is
     attached to the custom which prevails in officering the army; a
     custom which cannot be too soon corrected."&mdash;(<cite>Times, Feb. 10,

     to have demanded a very serious enquiry: for numberless are the
     evils that have resulted from it, besides that it has given so
     much disgust to veteran Officers, whose fortunes were not
     adequate to the purchase of rank. Various are the instances of

<p>The fate of a prisoner of War is always hard, and, as a rule, they are
not too luxuriously treated. When first we had large quantities of
French prisoners over here, they were nearly starved, but, afterwards,
their lot was much ameliorated. Probably they were better treated than
our people who were imprisoned in France, for, if the following letter
can be believed, they certainly were neither luxuriously housed, nor
fed.</p>

     <p>'I wrote by Lady Ann Fitzroy, which I hope you have received; we
     were in a very bad state at that time: but since she has been
     gone, we have been a great deal worse. They now serve out nothing

     together: and, when they do give meat, it is but six ounces of
     salt pork per man. It would make your <span class="pagenum"><a id="page110" name="page110"></a>(p. 110)</span> heart ache, to see
     our poor sailors, without money, without cloaths, worn down by
     sickness, and emaciated to the last degree, fighting over the
     body of a dead dog, which they sometimes pick up, and devour with
     the most voracious appetites: and it is a fact, that the head,
     and pluck, of a dog, sold for 30 sous, the other day. Such scenes
     as this, was I obliged to undergo: but I am now in a house
     allotted for the officers, and am rendered very comfortable by
     the friendship of our second lieutenant, Mr. Hadaway. I am the

     same as the line. It is apprehended, too, that it might still

     difficult to restrain. After parade here, on Saturday evening,
     Sir Joseph Mawbey, and other Officers, commanding the Surrey

with the roughest accommodation. Hard seats, plain tables, with no
Plate, nor floral decorations, no napkins; Knives and forks brandished
in a most reckless, and uncouth manner; an utter disregard for the
proprieties of the table, even to drinking the gravy out of a plate;
and intoxication, in its various phases, passing, seemingly,
unchallenged. A tankard of beer admitted to such a banquet, and two
people sharing the same "dish of tea," are all, to us, astounding
revelations of the social manners of our grandfathers.</p>

<p>From the following we get a curious glimpse of the Social economy, of
the times&mdash;a phase of thinking which would scarcely do nowadays:&mdash;</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"In a complicated machine, any of the inferior parts getting out
     of order, will soon obstruct the whole: and, conceiving such may
     be the case with public society, we are led to make <span class="pagenum"><a id="page115" name="page115"></a>(p. 115)</span> a
     few observations on some improprieties which occur in the present
     day.</p>

     <p>"The wages given to servants have increased during the last 10
     years, more than for 30, or perhaps 40, years before: and the
     misfortune is, that dissipation, and want of morals, have also
     much increased, particularly among manufacturing labourers, who
     now have got, in many places, only to work three, or four, days
     in the week, and to be drunk the remaining time, leaving their
     wives, and children, neglected, and in rags.</p>

     <p>"As to household servants, the accommodation offices for hiring
     of them, have had the worst effect. They make them indifferent
     about keeping their places; lure them on with false hopes, and
     often before a servant gets fixed, they, and the pawnbroker, put
     them under difficulties.</p>

     <p>"Travelling expences, by the profusion in the perquisites given
     to waiters, post boys, &amp;c., have become enormous, and their
     attention is less; but, if those who give in that way, were to
     consider the injury they do the public, and of how little use it
     is to those who receive it, they would certainly think such money
     so squandered away, would have been better bestowed, if applied
     to some public charity, or left for the poor of the parish.</p>

     <p>"Increase of trade, and wealth, having produced an increase of
     luxury, and made the necessaries of life more expensive, it is
     proper that wages should be increased: but yet not beyond the
     bounds of proportion; for it will be found in those manufacturing
     occupations, in which labourers get the most money, they are the
     most disorderly, continually combining together to leave their
     work, unless their masters consent to increase their wages, and
     which only proves a temporary compromise, till they have an
     opportunity of making a further demand. On the contrary, where
     less wages are given, we shall find the people more happy, and
     contented, their wives more attended to, and their children
     brought up with more religion, and better morals."&mdash;(<cite>Times,
     Sept. 5, 1794.</cite>)</p>

     <p class="p2 center">"To the CONDUCTOR of the TIMES.</p>

     <p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;Various are the receipts for cheap puddings, and many
     long, and useful, letters have appeared in your very <span class="pagenum"><a id="page116" name="page116"></a>(p. 116)</span>
     excellent paper, towards alleviating (as much as is in the power
     of every Housekeeper) the scarcity, and dearness, of bread: by
     substituting rice, and potatoes, in the room of pies, or flour
     puddings: but there still exists an evil which I have not seen
     spoken against, and which certainly occasions a very great
     consumption of starch: I mean the general fashion which has
     prevailed for some years, and does still, from the highest, to
     the lowest, of wearing white dresses, which, upon a moderate
     computation, for every individual, must consume at least double
     the soap, and starch, than when coloured callicoes, silks, and
     stuffs, were in fashion: Added to this, that every maid servant
     (who, though she is perhaps not worth a second pair of shoes)
     will wear her muslin handkerchiefs. I think it is the duty of
     every good master, and mistress, to stop, as much as possible,
     the present ridiculous, and extravagant, mode of dress in their
     domestics. View, on a Sunday, a tradesman's family coming from
     church, and you would be puzzled to distinguish the porter from
     his master, or the maid from her mistress. Formerly a plaited
     cap, and a white handkerchief, served a young woman three, or
     four, Sundays. Now a mistress is required to give up, by
     agreement, the latter end of the week for her maids to prepare
     their caps, tuckers, gowns, &amp;c., for Sunday, and, I am told,
     there are houses open on purpose, where those servants who do not
     choose their mistresses shall see them, carry their dresses in a
     bundle, and put them on, meet again in the evening, for the
     purpose of disrobing: and where, I doubt, many a poor, deluded,
     creature, has been disrobed of her virtue. They certainly call
     aloud for some restraint, both as to their dress, as well as
     insolent manner. Tell a servant, now, in the mildest manner, they
     have not done their work to please you, you are told to provide
     for yourself, and, should you offer to speak again, they are
     gone. Surely no set of people are more capable of rendering our
     families comfortable, or the reverse, than domestic servants, nor
     any set of people who feel the present dearness of provisions so
     little. I look upon their exorbitant increase of wages, as
     chiefly conducive to their impertinence: for, when they had five,
     or six, pounds a year, a month being out of place, was severely
     felt; but now their wages are doubled, they have, in a great
     measure, lost their dependence: And <span class="pagenum"><a id="page117" name="page117"></a>(p. 117)</span> what is this
     increase of wages for? not in order to lay by a little, in case

     bear a strong pair of leather shoes, but they must wear Spanish
     leather, and so on in every article of dress. No wonder, then,
     that there should be so many prostitutes, and so few good wives.</p>

<p class="p2">The <em>Penny Post</em> was an institution of those days, although its action
was limited as to distance. The following excerpts will enable us to
notice its different phases, during the years treated of:&mdash;</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"The Postmaster General has lately established a Penny Post at
     Manchester, which promises great convenience to the inhabitants
     of that place, and its vicinity."&mdash;(<cite>Times, April 17, 1793.</cite>)</p>

     <p class="p2">"The new <span class="smcap">Penny Post Office</span> is likely to prove such a very great
     accommodation to the public, that the only wonder is&mdash;it has been
     so long neglected. Instead of the number of deliveries, and the
     hours of despatch, varying in different parts <span class="pagenum"><a id="page120" name="page120"></a>(p. 120)</span> of the
     town, as at present, there will be six deliveries, each day, in
     all parts of the town: by which means, a person living at
     Mary-le-bonne, may send letters to, or receive letters from,
     Limehouse, a distance of seven miles, five times a day. Persons
     putting in letters by nine in the morning at the distance of ten
     miles from the chief Penny Post Office, and later, at less
     distant parts, may receive answers from London the same
     afternoon. There will be three deliveries of letters, in most
     parts of the country, within the limits of the Penny Post; and
     there will be two posts, daily, from all parts within the
     distance of ten miles from Lombard St."&mdash;(<cite>Times, Feb. 28,
     1794.</cite>)</p>

     <p class="p2">"The proposed plan of a new <span class="smcap">Penny Post</span> is no longer talked
     of:&mdash;It is every day more, and more, wanted, as the present mode
     is extremely irregular, and insufficient. According to the new
     plan, the Penny Post was to have gone out seven times a
     day."&mdash;(<cite>Times, May 4, 1794.</cite>)</p>

     <p class="p2 center">"The PENNY POST.</p>

     <p>"The late regulations in the <span class="smcap">Penny Post Office</span> are certainly of
     the most essential service to the public: but the conduct of the
     Letter Carriers requires the most minute attention. They wall
     defraud where they think they can do it with impunity; and as an
     instance of this, we give the following fact. From any part of
     the Metropolis, to the Borough of Southwark, and its adjacent
     parts, is stated to be but <em>One penny</em> per Letter. The Carriers,
     however, uniformly charged 2d. per Letter. A Complaint of this
     imposition was made to the Comptroller, by a Gentleman, whose
     house is in the Blackfriars Road, and an immediate answer was
     given 'that the Carrier had been severely reprimanded,' and the
     surcharge had been returned. His removal from that walk, gave his
     successor, who, perhaps, did not hear of this reprimand, an
     opportunity to continue the same imposition, and the letters to
     Blackfriars Road, and in other parts of St. George's Fields, were
     again charged 2d. The Comptroller was again applied to, and on
     the next evening, he wrote a letter to the person who sends this
     for publication, 'that the Carrier was ordered <span class="pagenum"><a id="page121" name="page121"></a>(p. 121)</span> to return
     the surcharge.' The publication of this circumstance is
     requisite, as no doubt, similar extortions are practised in other
     parts of the suburbs. This is a matter that ought to be
     universally made known, as cent. per cent., even on a <em>penny</em>,
     is rather too much for a man, illegally, to pay."&mdash;(<cite>Times, Oct.

<p>"Franking," as the privilege of free postage was called, had already
assumed dimensions, so as to have become a scandal, which is well
exposed in the following notices:&mdash;</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p class="center">"<span class="smcap">Motion respecting Clerks in Office.</span></p>

     <p>"Mr. <i>Dent</i> said ... Public notoriety went to accuse the offices
     of great abuse of the privilege of franking ... that such abuses
     did exist, and to give the proofs of them was the object which he
     proposed to gain by his present motion. He would state to the
     House some of the abuses. Certain bags came to the Post Office,
     marked Ordnance, Navy, Treasury Bags, &amp;c., and the letters
     contained in these bags were furthered without more enquiry.
     These bags, perhaps, contained a great quantity of letters from
     the various Clerks: he could produce an instance of a very
     inferior Clerk, who had franked to a great amount, by placing his
     initials on the superscription. He had looked attentively over
     the list of those who had the privilege, and he did not find his
     name among them.... Among other instances, he would mention a Mr.
     Lackington, a celebrated bookseller; he had friends in some one
     of the Offices, and the whole of his Catalogues were franked to
     different parts of the country. It was also notorious, that some
     persons had written to their country correspondents, that if they
     would deal with them, the whole mass of pamphlets published in
     London should be sent them free of postage: this was done by
     means of the Clerks in office. In short, there were persons whose
     salaries amounted to only £300, or £400 per annum, who from their
     situation, made £1000 or £1200. It surely could not be the
     intention of the House to permit such malversation, and,
     therefore, he should move for a Committee to enquire into these
     facts. Before the late regulation, venison has passed as <span class="pagenum"><a id="page122" name="page122"></a>(p. 122)</span>
     nimbly, by the post, as it run when alive in its native park.
     After further conversation, the House divided.&mdash;For the Question,
     53; Against it, 41.&mdash;Majority, 12."</p>

     <p>"It would have been extraordinary indeed, if Sir <span class="smcap">Benjamin Hammett</span>
     had not opposed the <span class="smcap">Franking</span> Bill: for we are informed from very
     good authority, that Letters franked by, and addressed to, him
     only, are to the amount of £2400 sterling <i lang="la">per annum</i>."&mdash;(<cite>Times,
     March 11, 1795.</cite>)</p>

     <p class="p2 center">"Debate on Franking.</p>

     <p>"Mr. <i>Hobart</i> brought up the Report of the Committee upon the
     Bill to restrain the abuse of Franking.</p>

<p>"Mr. <i>Dent</i> said, he was sorry to add, that this privilege had
     been notoriously abused, and was so publicly known, that
     paragraphs had appeared in a newspaper, of a Member having
     received £300 annually, from a mercantile house, to give them the
     advantage of this privilege. He hoped this fact was false, but he
     feared, however, it would be found too well warranted. By this
     Bill, Members were to receive only fifteen letters, and send ten,
     therefore the abuse, to this extent, could not be continued. At
     the same time, he thought, and should, bye-and-bye, more
     particularly state, in the motion he should submit to the House,
     that, when they were curtailing their own privileges, the Clerks
     in office should not be permitted to continue their abuses.</p>

<p>"Mr. <i>Courtenay</i> said, by the official returns it appeared that
     £30,000 was franked by the various offices, which amounted to one
     third of the whole of what was franked by Members of Parliament.
     Now the privilege was restrained in Members of Parliament, it
     would become more valuable to the Clerks in Office, and he should
     not wonder, if some of them should become not sleeping, but
     <em>writing</em>, partners in mercantile houses....</p>

<p>"Mr. <i>Dent</i> observed, abuses in the offices did exist to a very
     great degree. The Commissioners of the Customs received large
     Packets which contained letters to all their acquaintances in
     Town: the abuse did not end here: 20 Custom-House Porters were
     immediately dispatched to 20 different parts of the town.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page123" name="page123"></a>(p. 123)</span> "Mr. <i>W. Smith</i> said, ... Public notoriety was
     sufficient grounds to proceed against the Offices. Though all
     those letters were superscribed for His Majesty's service, yet
     they went upon many other purposes. A friend of his had informed
     him of some Vine cuttings, which had been sent to Ireland,
     franked: he also knew of a silk gown franked into the country:
     this was hardly for His Majesty's service.</p>

<p>"Mr. <i>Rose</i> said, if those abuses, mentioned by the Hon.
     Gentleman, had been privately intimated, they would have had
     immediate attention and some remedy applied. The laws to prevent
     the abuse of franking had been transmitted to the several
     Offices, and by them the first offence was a penalty, and the
     second, a dismissal from Office.</p>

<p>"The Bill was ordered to be read a third time on
     Friday."&mdash;(<cite>Times, April 14, 1795.</cite>)</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"<span class="smcap">The Telegraph.</span>&mdash;This mode of communication is little understood
     here, although the invention be not a new one. The process is
     getting possession of <em>heights</em> at convenient distances, and by
     fire-works, in different forms, for different letters, <em>spelling</em>
     the order, or intelligence, from station, to station!"&mdash;(<cite>Times,

     <p class="p2">"The new mode of correspondence, by the help of which, the
     surrender of <i>Quesnoy</i> was known at Paris an hour after the entry
     of the French troops into that place, is a communication by
     signals, which are repeated from distance, to distance, by
     machines, stationed four, or five, leagues asunder. This may
     explain the celerity with which communications are made.</p>

     <p>"The <em>telegraph</em>, now brought into use by the French, appears to
     have been an invention of Dr. <span class="smcap">Hooper's</span>, and published in his
     Rational Recreations, in 1774. The plan of which may <span class="pagenum"><a id="page125" name="page125"></a>(p. 125)</span> be
     seen in his 'Visual Correspondence.'"&mdash;(<cite>Times, Sept. 15, 1794.</cite>)</p>

     <p class="p2">"The invention of the Telegraphe, does not belong alone to the
     French. About ten years ago, Count <span class="smcap">Possini</span> at Rome, invented a
     mode of getting intelligence from Naples, in the course of an
     hour. The Lottery at Rome, depends upon that drawn at Naples. It
     differs from our Lottery, materially, for there are but six
     prizes, and these are the first six numbers drawn, and the
     remainder are all blanks. The Count, whose house is on an
     eminence near Rome, managed with his confederates, who were
     placed at certain distances, between Naples, and his estate, to
     have sky rockets let off, by which they had previously fixed with
     each other, to ascertain by such signals, any particular number,
     or numbers, drawn. The plan succeeded, as Tickets continued to be
     sold in Rome, for several hours after the drawing commenced at
     Naples, the account of which was always brought by the ordinary
     courier. By this scheme the party got about 100,000 crowns, and
     the plot would never have been discovered, had not the Count
     purchased the whole of the six prizes, which caused suspicion,
     and of course, excited enquiry."&mdash;(<cite>Times, Sept. 16, 1794.</cite>)</p>

     <p class="p2">"<span class="smcap">Astley</span>, who is always employed in the production of something

     <i lang="la">Lyceum</i>, in the Strand."&mdash;(<cite>Times, Sept. 19, 1794.</cite>)</p>

     <p class="p2">"The invention of the <span class="smcap">Telegraphe</span>, is now traced back to 1655, and
     particularly mentioned in a little book, then written, and
     published, by the Marquis of <span class="smcap">Worcester</span>, inventor of the Steam
     Engine. He there gives it the name of <em>Visual Correspondence</em>,
     and calls it his own invention."&mdash;(<cite>Times, Sept. 20, 1794.</cite>)</p>

     <p class="p2">"Experiments are now making at Woolwich with a new species of the
     <span class="smcap">Telegraphe</span>, to ascertain at what distance intelligence can be
     conveyed by it during the night. It is composed of letters, or
     figures, nine feet high, cut out in a <span class="pagenum"><a id="page126" name="page126"></a>(p. 126)</span> board, which is
     painted black in front, and strongly illuminated behind by patent
     lamps with reflectors; it is placed on the top of the butt
     against which the cannon are proved, and proper persons are
     stationed at Purfleet, and other intermediate places, with
     telescopes, to determine at what distance letters of that size
     are legible at night, by which means any word may be written, by
     a succession of letters, and intelligence may be conveyed, with
     astonishing celerity, during the night, by having a series of
     different signal-houses at proper distances between whatever

     <p class="p2">"It has been said, that a conversation had actually taken place
     across the Channel, between Donaghadee and Port Patrick, by means
     of a Telegraph. The following are the particulars: Two Gentlemen
     of the county of Longford have been, for sometime past, making
     experiments, in different positions, in that county, and they
     succeeded so well, as to induce them to undertake the journey to
     Donaghadee, where the Channel between Britain and Ireland is the
     narrowest, being about 18 Irish miles across. They brought down
     their machinery with them, and, having erected one on each side,
     they conversed with each other, on Monday evening last, the
     weather being tolerably clear. The conversation that passed was
     as follows&mdash;The Gentleman on this side said 'I see you, being
     white, distinctly.' The other replied 'I see you; I wish your's
     was white also.' (The machine on this side being black.) The
     Gentleman on this side then asked 'What o'clock is it?' and was
     answered 'Six.' He then said 'I will shew lights at nine o'clock,
     do you attend.' He was answered 'I will attend, but I have only
     one light.' They then made signals of 'good night,' and the
     communication ended. The machine consists of a triangle, with two
     long sides and a short one, suspended in the air vertically; it
     turns on a pivot, and is capable of being put into eight
     different positions, very distinct from each other. These
     positions represent eight of the common numerical figures, and

<p>On Nov. 22, 1798, Pitt brought forward his annual statement, relating
to public finance&mdash;and proposed to raise £7,000,000, by a new tax
called a triple assessment&mdash;but, eventually, it turned out that it,
with the land tax, brought in but about 4-1/2 Millions. A Briton can
extract some fun, even out of his misfortunes, so they caricatured
this heavy tax. In Dec. 1797 appeared a picture entitled "More
visitors to John Bull; or the Assessed Taxes"&mdash;showing four little
imps coming to John Bull. He naturally asks, "What do you want, you
little devils?&mdash;ain't I plagued with enough of you already? more pick
pocket's work, I suppose?" But <span class="pagenum"><a id="page132" name="page132"></a>(p. 132)</span> the <em lang="fr">diablotins</em> courteously
reply, "Please your honour, we are the Assessed Taxes."</p>

<p>On Dec. 3, 1798, Mr. Pitt again made his annual financial
statement&mdash;and, of course, he wanted more money&mdash;and the way by which
he proposed to raise the necessary funds&mdash;was by imposing a Tax on
Income. He proposed that no income under £60 a year should be
touched&mdash;and from that sum, to £200 per annum, should be on a smaller
scale than over £200&mdash;past which sum&mdash;a full tenth of all incomes
would be demanded. The returns were to be made by the person assessed,
subject to the inspection of a surveyor, who should lay before the
commissioners any grounds he might have for suspecting the return to
be false. The commissioners had no power to call for account books, or
to examine clerks, &amp;c. But, if the individual did not clear himself,
and they thought he had not returned sufficient, they could make such
assessment as they thought fit. After a long debate it was carried by
183 to 17, and made law on 18th Mar. 1799. By the accompanying
caricature, "A Visitor to John Bull, for the year 1799, or the
Assessed Taxes taking their leave," it was evidently the public
impression that the Income Tax would supersede the Assessed Taxes. But
it was not so, as they were still kept on.</p>

<p>The little demons still behave courteously towards John Bull, who
looks in undisguised horror at the size of the awful fund (the Income
Tax) now taking possession of him.</p>

it must be borne in mind that the War was a cruel drain on our fiscal
resources&mdash;and not one penny that had been granted by parliament could
be bated.</p>

     <p class="p2">"Among the numerous causes which may be assigned for the present
     high prices of provisions, especially of poultry, the uniting of
     many small farms into one great one, is not the least. It is a
     well known fact, that, where three farms have been leased, or
     let, to one tenant, which three farms, antecedently, had each a
     separate tenant, no more poultry is produced by the union, than
     each separately reared, when divided, so that two-thirds are, of
     course, lost to the public. This mode of throwing many small
     farms into one large farm, by <span class="pagenum"><a id="page138" name="page138"></a>(p. 138)</span> having one, instead of a
     number of tenants, however it may profit the landlord, is of very
     great injury to the public, inasmuch as it gives a kind of
     Aristocracy to the farmers, that enables them, in a great
     measure, to set what price they please upon provisions,
     destroying that competition, which is always the consequence,
     where the venders are numerous. Thus it is that a great part of
     Oxfordshire has been bought up by a noble Duke, who, by
     monopolizing so much land, and destroying a number of small

     <span class="pagenum"><a id="page142" name="page142"></a>(p. 142)</span> the use of standard wheaten Bread (see the Advertisement
     in the <cite>Times</cite> of Tuesday last 14th inst.). The Court resolved to

     <p class="p2">"We offer the following hints for the government of individuals
     in affluent circumstances, with a view of reducing the high price
     of provisions:&mdash;</p>

     <p>"To have fish at table as often as possible.</p>

     <p>"To sit down with a determined resolution to eat only of one kind
     of butcher's meat; and, where circumstances will admit, to have
     only one dish of meat at table.</p>

     <p>"To forbid the use of pastry in your own house, and to decline
     the use of it at any other table.</p>

     <p>"To be particularly economical in the use of bread, and to cut,
     yourself, what you use at your own table; making your servants
     sensible that you give such directions from a regard to the
     comforts of the poor, and not from any penurious views. It
     appears, indeed, to be of the utmost consequence to make servants
     <span class="pagenum"><a id="page143" name="page143"></a>(p. 143)</span> in great, and even small families, sensible how much
     they may, under present circumstances, contribute to the relief,
     and comfort, of the poor, which every British heart must wish to
     do.</p>

     <p>"Bakers ought to be prevented from selling bread of the same
     day's baking, as, on a fair calculation, four stale loaves are
     equal to five new ones."&mdash;(<cite>Times, July 16, 1795.</cite>)</p>

     <p class="p2">"At a period when every species of grain has become both scarce,
     and dear, it is the duty of every individual to inform the public
     of any possible diminution in the consumption. It is with this
     view that we feel much satisfaction in announcing to all who keep
     horses for draught, that a saving of <em>twenty-five per cent.</em> in
     Oats, has been introduced into the stables of <span class="smcap">Thrale's Brewhouse</span>,
     in the Borough, since the month of September last, which we are
     happy to learn has been adopted by several other principal
     manufacturers. Their plan is simply to <em>roll all their oats</em>
     between two iron cilinders, which they have attached to their
     steam engine. By this process, an <em>increase</em> is found of two
     bushels a <em>sack</em>. After being well rolled (which is usually done
     twice, or thrice, a week) the Oats are <em>mixed with chaff</em> of the
     best quality, and divided in the usual manner. This mode of
     rolling, is deemed equal to mastication. It is found, from
     experience, equally beneficial to <em>old</em> horses, whose teeth may
     be impaired, as well as <em>young</em> horses, who often return home
     very hungry, and are apt to swallow their oats without chewing
     them, by which means they are frequently observed to pass through
     them undigested."&mdash;(<cite>Times, July 16, 1795.</cite>)</p>

     <p class="p2">"It is now almost the prevailing custom in every family of
     distinction, to have the loaf brought on the table, and each
     person to help himself. This example must have a considerable
     influence in reducing the consumption of this, as well as other,
     necessaries of life.</p>

     <p>"The custom of wearing <span class="smcap">Hair-Powder</span> is growing into very general
     disuse: and we shall not be surprised if we soon see it almost
     altogether abolished, during the present scarcity of grain.</p>

     <p>"The recommendation of the Privy Council, to adopt the use of
     Household Bread, will be of little avail, unless their <em>request</em>
     is converted into an <em>order</em>, that no bread, above that <span class="pagenum"><a id="page144" name="page144"></a>(p. 144)</span>
     standard, shall hereafter be baked: and every idea of expediency,
     and common policy, demands that some measure of this tendency
     should immediately be enforced."&mdash;(<cite>Times, July 17, 1795.</cite>)</p>

     <p class="p2">"There is no economy more laudable at this moment, than that of
     lessening the consumption of bread, in private families. This has
     been practised with such success, by Mr. <span class="smcap">Parish</span>, on Ludgate Hill,
     that he now consumes but four <span class="smcap">Brown</span> loaves per week, in lieu of
     twelve, or thirteen, White ones, as formerly. This is a most
     notable example, and, we trust, will be imitated by many, though
     perhaps with somewhat less rigour. Mr. P.'s substitute for bread,
     are, principally, potatoes, and rice."&mdash;(<cite>Times, July 18, 1795.</cite>)</p>

     <p class="p2">"In Sussex, the Gentry have adopted the most rational mode of
     diminishing the price of Corn. Instead of supplying the poor with
     bread, at a low price, which can only tend to increase the
     consumption, they give pickled pork, &amp;c., to an equal amount,
     which, with the use of cabbage, beans, &amp;c., may banish, without
     much suffering, the loaf, at least, from their dinner
     tables."&mdash;(<cite>Times, July 20, 1795.</cite>)</p>

     <p class="p2">"After the humane example of the City, in leaving off their
     annual feasts, we are happy to find it is <em>intended</em> to be
     universally adopted by the surrounding parishes, and opulent
     families; <em>particularly</em> by some of the principal inhabitants of
     <i>Whitechapel</i>, who, at one of their Greenwich meetings, on
     Monday, wisely determined to eat venison, and white-bait, <em>no

<p>5. Save all your skim-milk carefully, and give it all to the

     <p>6. Make broth, rice pudding, &amp;c., for the poor, and teach them to
     make such things.</p>

     <p>7. Go to church yourselves, and take care your servants go
     constantly.</p>

     <p>8. Look into the management of your own families, and visit your
     poor neighbours.</p>

     <p>9. Prefer those poor who keep steadily to their work, and go
     constantly to church, and give nothing to those who are idle, and
     riotous, or keep useless dogs.</p>

     <p>10. Buy no weighing meat, or gravy beef: if the rich would buy
     only the prime pieces, the poor could get the others cheap.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Rules for the Poor.</span></p>

     <p>1. Keep steadily to your work, and never change masters, if you
     can help it.</p>

     <p>2. Go to no gin-shop, or alehouse: but lay out all your earnings

     contented themselves with several haunches of venison, and a
     number of <em>venison pasties</em>, which consumed flour enough for 50
     fruit pies. And in order to adopt the above resolution of no
     pies, the Court of Assistants had, previously, a snug dinner,
     consisting of all the delicacies of the season. Of public

     On the same principle, the late advance in the price of Milk, in
     the Metropolis, should be enquired into. London is supplied with
     Milk by about 30 cow-keepers, who may at pleasure either deprive
     the city of this necessary article, or extort what price they may

     owing to any real scarcity of oxen, sheep, or hogs, but, partly,
     to a combination among the carcass-butchers in the wholesale
     markets, and the salesmen in Smithfield, who fix the prices, and
     who regulate what quantity of cattle shall come to town: and,
     partly, to a very shameful practice among the retail butchers,
     especially where a contract is made to supply a family at so much
     per pound for the year. When the butcher has made his contract at
     5d., 5-1/2d., or 6d., he can make a very great profit, although,
     as is now the case, he can purchase a carcass at 7-1/2d. in the
     wholesale markets: and the mode by which he does this, is in
     defrauding his customers of the due weight, to which the person,
     who attends to see the meat weighed, too often connives at, for a
     Christmas present, or an Easter gift. The weight, no doubt is in
     the scale, at the time of weighing: but when the meat is put by,
     in order to be sent home, a considerable part is purloined: and
     it is a well known fact, that, in these large lots, the same leg
     of beef(?) has been weighed to, perhaps, ten or twelve families,
     in the same day, and not sent to any of them. The leg is
     considered as the most convenient for this theft, because it is
     so large, and is, when weighed with the lot, hung on the end of
     the beam of the scales, from whence it is taken down, and thrown,
     not where it ought, with the meat, but to another part of the
     shop. If this was not the case, how is it possible that a butcher
     can make a livelihood, when he buys 2d. per pound dearer than he
     sells? The fact speaks for itself. The mode which all families

<p>Coals, though, of course, not an article of Food, were undoubtedly of
use in cooking it: and may therefore be mentioned here. Our
Grandfathers paid very dearly for them: but it must be remembered
there was no land carriage, and a continued contrary wind, or a "hot
press," would leave the London Market bare. The magnificent basins of
Inland Coals were scarcely known, and only those like the Moira
Collieries, near to a Canal, could be worked. They were sold to the
consumer at per Chaldron of 2800 lbs., and the prices below quoted
represent them ex-ship. Add to this the cost of delivery and profit
12s., and take the Sovereign as being worth 30s., and it will much
account for the small stoves then in vogue.</p>

     profits on unusual events, which has, we understand, occasioned
     six, and seven, guineas to be given for a chaldron of coals,
     within a few days past, but, had the frost continued, coals would
     have been considerably cheaper, than at present, as the ice
     admitted the coals being worked over it. There are, at present,
     near 50 sail of colliers in the river, not unladen, which contain
     about 10,000 chaldrons, for an immediate supply, (but not ten

<h3>THE ROAD AND STREETS.</h3>

<p>The Highways and Streets were in very far from good condition, the
roads being full of ruts, and the streets when paved, were made of
large "Cobble" Stones, and were full of holes, ofttimes very
dangerous, as we shall see. The foot pavement, except in some of the
best streets, which were flagged, was very narrow, and made of
"Kidney" stones on end, such as may still be met with in the bye-ways
of some country towns. Consequently no one stirred out more than they
could help; the men always on horseback, if single&mdash;by "Post," if
accompanied by ladies. It will have been noticed in "Men's dress"
that they all wear boots, if not in the house, and the reason is
plain&mdash;they had to be protected against the mud of the streets, and
ready for the saddle. Every man had to learn to ride, and no doubt
this laid the foundation of the Continental opinion, that every
Englishman is a good horseman.</p>

affair with very broad wheels&mdash;and some eight horses, the driver being

following is a very humorous story of a journey by Wagon:&mdash;</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p class="center">"A DELIGHTFUL RIDE,</p>

     <p class="center"><span class="smcap">"In the ten-wheeled Caravan, from Greenwich to London</span>.</p>

     <p>"We were twenty-four passengers within side, and nine without. It
     was my lot to sit in the middle, with a very lusty woman on one
     side, and a very thin man on the other. 'Open the window,' said
     the former, and she had a child on her lap, whose hands and face
     were all besmeared with gingerbread. 'It can't be opened,' said a
     little prim coxcomb, 'or I shall get cold.'&mdash;'But I say it
     shall, Sir,' said a Butcher, who sat opposite to him, and the
     Butcher opened it; but, as he stood, or rather bent forward to do
     this, the caravan came into a rut, and the Butcher's head, by the
     suddenness of the jolt, came into contact with that of the woman
     who sat next to me, and made her nose bleed. He begged her
     pardon, and she gave him a slap on the face that sounded through
     the whole caravan. Two sailors, that were seated near the helm of
     this machine, ordered the driver to cast anchor at the next
     public-house. He did so; and the woman next to me, called for a
     pot of ale, which she offered to me, after she had emptied about
     a pint of it, observing, that 'as how she loved ale mightily.' I
     could not drink, at which she took much offence; and said, 'I was
     mighty squeamish; but thank God, she was as good as I, and kept a
     lodging-house in Craven St., where she saw <em>her betters</em> every
     day, and so,' continues she, 'here's to you, my dear:' and she
     finished the pot. A violent dispute now arose between two stout
     looking men, the one a Recruiting Sergeant, and the other a
     Gentleman's Coachman, about the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page160" name="page160"></a>(p. 160)</span> <em>Rights of Man</em>: and,
     having struck two or three blows in the Caravan, they got out
     into the road, to decide whether <i>Tom Paine</i> was an <em>Atheist</em>, or
     a <em>Deist</em>. In this contest, victory fell to the Sergeant, and the
     driver of the horses was so mauled by the leader of men, that he
     was lifted into the vehicle, where he sat in sullen silence all
     the rest of the journey.</p>

     <p>"Another dispute afterwards arose about politics, which was
     carried on with such warmth, as to draw the attention of the
     company to the head of the Caravan, where the combatants sat
     wedged together like two pounds of Epping butter, whilst a child
     incessantly roared at the opposite side, and the mother abused
     the two politicians for frightening her babe. The heat was now so
     great that all the windows were opened, and with the fresh air,
     entered clouds of dust, for the body of the machine is but a few
     inches from the surface of the road.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that then, as now, the <cite>Times</cite>, was a powerful organ
for calling public attention to social grievances, and that people
"wrote to" that paper as at the present time. We, in our time, know
the little social inconveniences arising from staying at Hotels,
where, not only does the proprietor charge for attendance, which we,
no more than the writer of this letter, can understand is not included

to "tip" the servants as well.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p class="center">"To the CONDUCTOR of the TIMES.</p>

     <p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;Having frequent occasion to travel many of the principal
     roads of England, I have often witnessed the exorbitant demands
     of Inn-keepers, and the no less serious ones of their domestics,
     sanctioned only by custom, yet arisen to such <span class="pagenum"><a id="page161" name="page161"></a>(p. 161)</span> a pitch as
     to become a burthen unable to be borne by the <em>poor Tradesman</em>
     who is obliged to travel to sell his goods, as well as an
     inconvenience to the person in <em>middling circumstances</em> of
     <em>life</em>, who, for his health, or otherwise, has occasion to
     travel. Grievances (the latter of which especially), are only
     suffered to exist from the disinclination people have to break
     through a custom, or to appear singular. Having hinted at the
     former, I shall only shew the nature, and point out a remedy for
     the latter. It is well known, that let an Innkeeper's bill be
     ever so exorbitant, you must not only comply with it, but also
     give the servants just as much as if it was reasonable: so that
     there is no end of the expence: for instance, if a man who has a
     horse, puts up at an inn, besides the usual bill, he must at
     least give 1<i>s.</i> to the waiter, 6<i>d.</i> to the chamber-maid, 6<i>d.</i>
     to the hostler, and 6<i>d.</i> to the jack-boot, making together 2<i>s.</i>
     6<i>d.</i>, and this to be repeated every night he lays on the road (I
     speak now of what's expected from those who appear in middling
     circumstances of life). The same expence in proportion occurs in
     the course of the day: at breakfast, you must give at least 6<i>d.</i>
     between the waiter and hostler. If the traveller only puts up to
     have a refreshment, besides paying for his horse's standing, he
     must give 3<i>d.</i> to the hostler: at dinner 6<i>d.</i> to the waiter and
     3<i>d.</i> to the hostler: at tea 6<i>d.</i> between them, so that he gives
     away in the day 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, which added to the 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> for
     the night, makes 5<i>s.</i> per day on an average to servants. Thus he
     is putting his hand in his pocket from morning till night, not
     merely to satisfy the Landlord's demand, but to appease the
     croaking of domestics, who, it is well known, will let you see,
     or feel, their displeasure in some way or other if you do not, so
     that it is disagreeable to go to that inn the second time where
     you do not behave with profuseness at the first, and there is
     not only the above inconvenience, but also this, that after all
     your givings they are not satisfied, but often abuse you for your
     liberality. The following anecdote proves this:&mdash;Coming home from
     Colchester some time since, I put up at an Inn at Ingatestone,
     the Innkeeper's bill was as follows:&mdash;Supper 1<i>s.</i>, beer 3<i>d.</i>,
     bed 1<i>s.</i>, horse and corn 1<i>s.</i> 7<i>d.</i>&mdash;together 3<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i> I
     gave away as <span class="pagenum"><a id="page162" name="page162"></a>(p. 162)</span> follows: waiter 1<i>s.</i>, chambermaid 6<i>d.</i>,
     jack-boot 6<i>d.</i>, hostler, the change out of 2<i>s.</i> I paid him for
     the horse, being 5<i>d.</i>, together 2<i>s.</i> 5<i>d.</i>, being 1<i>s.</i> 5<i>d.</i>
     less than the bill. Yet the hostler was so abusive, because I did
     not give him more than the odd 5<i>d.</i> change, that he actually
     threatened me that he would mark me if I came there again. I
     therefore did, what I wish every one would do in the like case,
     punish him on the spot for his insolence. I appeared to relent
     that I had not given him more, and desired him to give me the
     half-pence again that I might see for silver for him, which after
     he had done, I rode off, leaving him to repent he had not kept
     what I first gave him. It may be alleged that these servants have
     little or no wages, and therefore ought to receive liberally. Be
     that as it may, it is very hard that I am to pay wages to another
     man's servants. I pay the master his bill, in which he makes a
     charge sufficient to cover his servants' wages, and then he
     leaves me to pay his servants besides. If Innkeepers have nothing
     to pay for servants, their charges ought to be reasonable in
     proportion. But I would meet another objection that is likely to
     be made, which is, that what is given to servants at inns is not
     to be considered as wages, but as their perquisites. There are
     two answers to this, the one, that the very notion of
     perquisites, signifies something gotten over and above their
     usual wages, whereas it is notorious, that most Innkeepers allow
     their servants no wages: the other, that perquisites signify a
     gift, now a gift is free, and may be much, or little, as suits
     the inclination of the giver, but, according to the modern custom
     at inns, he is not permitted to use his discretion, but there
     must be a settled sum given to each servant, fixed as to the
     lowest quantum, though as much above that mark as he pleases,
     and, if he gives less than custom warrants, they have the
     impudence to tell him of it. Besides, why should Innkeepers, be
     exempted from paying their servants wages, any more than any
     other tradesman. If I go into a shop, to buy a few yards of any
     thing, I am not charged so much for the trouble of the shopman
     who cut it off. Tradesmen are contented to pay their servants out
     of the profit of their bills, without saddling it upon their
     customers: and I am fully persuaded, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page163" name="page163"></a>(p. 163)</span> were travellers of
     all descriptions to withhold for a certain time their usual gifts
     to servants at inns, it would ultimately tend to the benefit of
     those servants themselves, as well as the comfort of travellers,
     for when the servants find their finances so low, they would
     insist upon, and would not hire themselves without stipulated
     wages, after which, travellers might again resume their former
     generosity, and what they then gave, would be looked upon in the
     light it ought, as a gift, and not a debt.</p>

<h2><span class="pagenum"><a id="page166" name="page166"></a>(p. 166)</span> GAMING, &amp;c.</h2>

<p>We, in this Nineteenth Century of ours, are not so free from the vice
of gambling, that we can afford the luxury of being particularly
censorious over the habits of the last century. We have legislated
against gambling, we are better educated, all our surroundings are
refined, compared to those which our forefathers had to make the most
of. Literature, Art, and Music, are all far more popular, and yet&mdash;are
there not Clubs, thinly veiled indeed, but really, and truly, solely
existing for card playing for high stakes, as much as Crockford's ever
was? Have we not reduced the Turf to a science? and has it not come to
such a pass, that an honest Nobleman like Lord Falmouth, will no
longer run his race horses, because of the roguery on the Turf? Is not
the Stock Exchange one huge Gamble? Therefore, in reading the notes
about gaming, in "Old Times," let us remember the beams in our own
eyes, before making a fuss about the motes, that used to be in the
eyes of those that are dead and gone.</p>

<p>But, although Card playing was the rule at every house, in the
evening, yet some did not play, and the utter weariness which is
shewn in this little sketch of Gillray's, is extremely natural and
vivid.</p>

<p>It is in 1789 that we first hear of Lady Archer, who, with Lady
Buckinghamshire, figures so prominently in keeping gaming tables.</p>

<p>"A Kick up at a Hazard Table," by Rowlandson, is not only well
drawn&mdash;but, doubtless, depicts a gambling affray, to the life.</p>

<p>Lady Archer, and Lady Buckinghamshire did not monopolise the gaming
tables, there were other ladies in the field, and, as the game
generally played, was <em>Faro</em>, these <em>brelandieres</em> were called <em>Faro's
Daughters</em>.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"Mrs. Sturt's house, in St. James Square, was opened yesterday
     evening, for the first time this season, for public play. The
     visitors were numerous."&mdash;(<cite>Times, Feb. 5, 1793.</cite>)</p>

     <p class="p2">"Many of our young sprigs of fashion, when the campaign opens,
     will have other game to attend to than the game of Faro. By
     risquing their persons they may serve their country; but by
     risquing their property, they can neither benefit the nation, nor
     do any good to themselves. Cocking a fire lock will redound more
     to their honour than cocking a card: and as they are fond of a
     game of <em>Hazard</em>, let them take the <em>chance</em> of the field, in
     preference to that of the gaming table:</p>

     <p>"Some of the <em>Faro Ladies</em> have opened their play houses, and
     announced the <em>Road to Ruin</em> until further notice. The
     <em>Gamesters</em> was publicly rehearsed in St. James Square on Monday
     night."&mdash;(<cite>Times, Feb. 6, 1793.</cite>)</p>

     <p class="p2"><span class="pagenum"><a id="page168" name="page168"></a>(p. 168)</span> "The number of new gaming-houses, established at the
     West End of the town, is, indeed, a matter of very serious evil:
     but they are not likely to decrease while examples of the same
     nature are held forth in the higher circles of life. It is
     needless to point out any one of these houses in particular: it
     is sufficient for us to expose the tricks that are practised at
     many of them to swindle the unsuspecting young men of fortune who
     are entrapped into these whirlpools of destruction. The first
     thing necessary is, to give the guests a good dinner and plenty
     of wine, which many of these houses do, gratis. When they are
     sufficiently intoxicated, and, having lost all the money about
     them, their acceptance is obtained to Bills of Exchange to a
     considerable amount, which frequently are paid to avoid the
     disagreeable circumstance of a public exposition in a Court of
     Justice, which is always threatened, though the gamesters well
     know that no such measure durst be adopted by them.</p>

     <p>"Should any reluctance, or hesitation, be shewn by the injured
     party, to accept these bills, he is shewn into a long room, with
     a target at the end of it, and several pistols lying about, where
     he is given to understand these sharpers practice a considerable
     time of the day in shooting at a mark, and have arrived to such
     perfection in this exercise, that either of them can shoot a
     pistol ball within an inch of the mark, from the common distance
     taken by duellists. A hint is then dropped, that further
     hesitation will render the use of the pistols necessary, and
     which will again be the case, should he ever divulge what he has
     seen, and heard.</p>

     <p>"If further particulars, or proofs, are wanting, they may be
     known on application to certain <em>Military characters</em>, who have
     already made some noise in the world."&mdash;(<cite>Times, Feb. 14, 1793.</cite>)</p>

<p>The Illustration "Modern Hospitality, or a Friendly Party in High
Life," is by Gillray, 31st Mar. 1792, and in it we see Lady Archer,

<em lang="fr">passées</em>, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page169" name="page169"></a>(p. 169)</span> the picture has the following, "To those earthly
Divinities who charmed 20 years ago, this Honorable method of
banishing mortifying reflections is dedicated. O, Woman! Woman!
everlasting is your power over us, for in youth, you charm away our

<p>It is a pity we have not the key to the portraits of the bystanders,
for portraits they, undoubtedly, are, because there is such
individuality in the expression of their several countenances. The
players we can easily recognise&mdash;Lady Archer, at the extreme left, has
won largely, rouleaux of gold, and bank notes, are before her, and on
her right hand are two heaps of loose gold;&mdash;with what a smiling
countenance does the painted old gambler shew her cards, saying, "The
Knave wins all!"</p>

<p>Her next door neighbour, the Prince of Wales, who has staked, and
lost, his last piece, lifts his hands, and eyes, in astonishment at
the luck. Lady Buckinghamshire has doubled her stake, playing on two
cards, and is evidently annoyed at her loss&mdash;whilst poor, black
muzzled Fox, laments the loss of his last three pieces.</p>

     their lodgings, and houses, of an evening, for the purpose of
     attracting company, whose pockets are to be taxed by Gallic

     <p class="p2 center">"To the CONDUCTOR of the TIMES.</p>

     <p>"Sir,&mdash;London is certainly an eligible place for persons who have
     nothing but their labour to depend on, to get forward in life,
     provided they steer clear of the many snares, and temptations,
     which hover in every alley, street, winding, and corner.</p>

     <p>"The mischief is, however, that the generality of young men, the
     moment they set foot in town, or, if brought up in the
     Metropolis, directly they enter the world on their own account,
     are hurried away, thoughtlessly, with the stream of error, and
     dissipation. If he happens to be a young man possessed of a
     moderate independence, without the suggestion of prudence, the
     caution of experience, the councils of wisdom or the restraint of
     authority, his whole conduct is then influenced by the passion
     with which he is actuated, which becomes at once, whether good or
     bad, his impulse, and his guide.</p>

     <p>"The Play-house is the first place of resort, which from the
     frequency of his visits, instead of being an instructive
     amusement, or a moral lesson, turns out a rendezvous of intrigue,
     and intemperance, where he soon acquires an intimacy with the
     idle, the profligate, the gambler, and the prostitute, who eye
     him as their lawful prey, and with all that ease, dexterity, and
     artifice, which a knowledge of the town, and its vicissitudes,
     has furnished them with, they imperceptibly lead him from one
     crime to another, till at length he becomes extravagant, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page175" name="page175"></a>(p. 175)</span>
     and irregular, callous, and abandoned. Bagnios, gaming-tables,
     horses, and black-legs, are now his only wish, theme, and
     delight, and, so long as his pocket will endure the burden, so
     long, and no longer, is he duped, flattered, caressed, and
     encouraged, by those who surround him. But everything must have
     an end, and enormous expenditures cannot keep pace with that
     income which should be managed with care and frugality. The young
     Gentleman <em>runs short</em>, as it is termed, and, on his first
     embarrassment, is advised to apply for the assistance of some
     <em>friendly advertising money lender</em>, who, upon proper security,
     has the <em>modesty</em> to procure him from time to time, sums of
     money, at the <em>equitable premium of 100 per cent</em>. A repetition
     so involves him, that, by degrees, his estate falls into the
     hands of Mr. Usurer, who takes an <em>absolute assignment of his
     estate</em>, for a consideration less than half its true value: and
     reflection never once enters his head, but he unfortunately
     squanders the last shilling: but it is, now, he conceives, a
     folly to repent, or retreat: consequently he gets into debt, is
     arrested, carried to a spunging house, and from thence is removed
     to the King's Bench, or Fleet Prison.</p>

     <p>"Far be it from me to throw any odium on an unfortunate class of
     people immured in the walls of either of those places, there are
     no doubt, imprisoned, as worthy, and as good a set of people, as
     any in society. But the young spark I am speaking of, being
     mortified at his late companions standing aloof, and resigning
     him to his fate, becomes loaded with obloquy, associates with
     characters equally as vicious as himself, smoaks, swears, and
     carouses, and, all at once, is wholly lost, as it were to
     himself, and to the world.</p>

<p>These two illustrations are almost Hogarthian in their contrast, and
preach a homily, better than pages of text would do, on the similarity

quarrelling over gold, bank notes, a sword, and an Order. One other
lady, probably Lady Mount Edgcumbe, scrutinising a bill&mdash;whilst the
fourth, with a pile of gold, and notes, before her, looks calmly on.

<p>It was about this time that special attention was called to this
gaming mania, and Gillray (?) on the 16th May, 1796, published a
Caricature called "Faro's Daughters, or the Kenyonian blow up to
gamblers." Here we see the Lady Archer, and Mrs. Concannon, placed
together in the pillory, and mutually upbraiding each other.</p>

<p>The <em>motif</em> for this picture was a speech of Lord <span class="pagenum"><a id="page178" name="page178"></a>(p. 178)</span> Kenyon's,
who, at a trial to recover £15, won at gaming, on Sunday, at a public
house&mdash;commented very severely on the hold, the vice of gaming had, on
all classes of society, from the highest, to the lowest. The former,
he said, set the example to the latter&mdash;and, he added, "They think
they are too great for the law; I wish they could be punished,"&mdash;and
then continued, "If any prosecutions of this kind are fairly brought
before me, and the parties are justly convicted, whatever be their
rank, or station, in the country&mdash;though they be the first ladies in
the land&mdash;they shall certainly exhibit themselves in the pillory."</p>

     that arise from the practice of private Lotteries, which at
     present are carrying on, in various parts of the town, to very
     alarming extents, much to the discredit of those whose province
     it is to suppress such nefarious practices, as they cannot be
     ignorant of such transactions. 'The little go,' which is the
     technical term for a private Lottery, is calculated only for the
     meridian of those understandings, who are unused to calculate,
     and discriminate, between right, and wrong, and roguery, and
     fair-dealing; and, in this particular case, it is those who
     compose the lower order of society, whom it so seriously affects,
     and on whom it is chiefly designed to operate. No man of common
     sense can suppose that the Lottery Wheels are fair, and honest,
     or that the proprietors act upon principles anything like honor,
     or honesty; for, by the art, and contrivance, of the Wheels, they
     are so constructed, with secret springs, and the application of
     gum, glue, &amp;c., in the internal part of them, that they can draw
     the numbers out, or keep them in, at pleasure, just as it suits
     their purposes; so that the insurer, robbed, and cajoled, by such
     unfair means, has not the most distant chance of ever winning:
     the whole being a gross fraud, and imposition, in the extreme. We
     understand the most notorious of these standards of imposition
     are situated in Carnaby Market, Oxford Road, in the Borough,
     Islington, Clerkenwell, and various other places, most of
     <span class="pagenum"><a id="page183" name="page183"></a>(p. 183)</span> which are under the very nose of Magistracy, in seeming

     possess the same power, will perform their duty on behalf of the
     poor, over whom they preside, and put a stop to such a growing,
     and alarming, evil, of such pernicious, and dangerous tendency:
     particularly, as the Proprietors are well-known bad characters,
     consisting of needy beggars, desperate swindlers, gamblers,

the people in the taste for gambling. Here are two anecdotes of the
lottery:&mdash;</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"Dr. B., a physician at <em>Lime</em> (Dorset), a few days since, being
     under pecuniary embarrassment, and his house surrounded by
     bailiffs, made his escape by a window, into a neighbour's house,
     from whence he fled to London. The furniture was seized, and the
     sale actually commenced, when it was stopped by a letter, stating
     that the Doctor, upon his arrival in London, found himself the
     proprietor of the £20,000 prize. We guarantee the truth of this
     fact."&mdash;(<cite>Times, Dec. 27, 1797.</cite>)</p>

     <p class="p2">"The £20,000 prize, drawn on Friday, is divided amongst a number
     of poor persons: a female servant in Brook St., Holborn, had a
     sixteenth; a woman who keeps a fruit-stall in Grays-Inn-lane
     another; a third is possessed by a servant of the Duke of
     <span class="smcap">Roxburghe's</span>; a fourth by a Chelsea Carrier of vegetables to
     Covent Garden; one eighth belongs to a poor family in
     Rutlandshire, and the remainder is similarly divided."&mdash;(<cite>Times,
     Mar. 19, 1798.</cite>)</p>
</div>

<p>Of Horse Racing we do not hear much&mdash;the prizes were small&mdash;and
gambling on the Turf was not reduced to a Science as it is now-a-days.
Even when attending races, the chief losses were at the gaming tables
which accompanied them.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"Poor <em>Newmarket</em> is completely done up! The Spring Meeting
     boasts so few bets in the calendar of gambling, that the chance
     will not pay post-chaise hire to the black legs. Thus falls the
     destructive sport of the Turf&mdash;and, as that is the case, it would
     do honour to his Majesty to change the <em>King's Plates</em> into
     rewards for the <em>improvement of Agriculture</em>."&mdash;(<cite>Times, April
     17, 1794.</cite>)</p>

     driving about the course, with two very pretty <em lang="fr">emigrées</em> in it.
     The Duke was in his cabriolet. The Duke of <span class="smcap">Bedford</span>, Lords
     <span class="smcap">Egremont</span>, and <span class="smcap">Derby</span>, were also on the course. Several carriages

<div class="chapter">
<h2><span class="pagenum"><a id="page187" name="page187"></a>(p. 187)</span> THE THEATRE.</h2>

<p>Our forefathers were fond of the Theatre, and patronised it nightly.
They were exacting as to the quality of the acting represented before
them, and that very <em>exigeance</em> procured them what they wanted.</p>

<p>In the years of which I treat, there were, in London, the following
Theatres:&mdash;The King's (now Her Majesty's) in the Haymarket&mdash;Drury
Lane&mdash;Covent Garden&mdash;The Theatre Royal, Haymarket&mdash;Royalty Theatre,
Wells Street, Goodman's Fields&mdash;Royal Circus, St. George's
Fields&mdash;Sadler's Wells&mdash;The Royal Grove, and Amphitheatre (Astley's)
Westminster Bridge&mdash;afterwards Astley's Royal Saloon&mdash;and still later
called, Astley's Amphitheatre of Arts. Whilst at the Lyceum in the
Strand, there were Musical Entertainments, and a New Circus.</p>

<p>It was an age of good actors, and, taking them haphazard, we have only
to glance at the following names, to prove the assertion, were it
needed. <i>Suett</i>, who drank himself to death in 1805. <i>John Kemble</i>,
the best tragic actor since Garrick. From an education for the
priesthood, to performing with a strolling company, was a great
leap&mdash;but his success was assured when, in 1783, he made his début, at
Drury Lane, as Hamlet. He retired from the stage in 1817, and died in
1823. <i>Baddeley</i> was not a first rate actor, and I but mention him
because of his bequest of Cake, and Wine, to be <span class="pagenum"><a id="page188" name="page188"></a>(p. 188)</span> partaken of,
annually, by the Company, in the Green room of Drury Lane, every
Twelfth night. <i>Quick</i> was irresistibly comic&mdash;and none could see him
act without laughing. He lived to a good old age (acting up to 1813),
above 83&mdash;dying in the year 1831.</p>

<p><i>Edmund Kean</i> was born in 1787, and went on the stage as soon as he
could walk.&mdash;After his education at Eton, he went on the provincial
boards&mdash;not playing in London, until 1814, when he played Shylock, at
Drury Lane. Died 1833. <i>Macklin</i>, "the Jew, that Shakespeare drew,"
acted until he was 90&mdash;appearing, for the last time, on the occasion
of his benefit, May 7, 1789. After he was dressed for Shylock, he went
into the Green Room, and, seeing Mrs. Pope there, said "My dear, are
you to play to-night?" "To be sure I am, Sir," she replied, "do you
not see I am dressed for Portia?"&mdash;"Ah! very true; I had
forgotten&mdash;but who is to play Shylock!" They got his poor old feeble
mind, at last, to grasp the situation, and he went on the stage&mdash;but,
after two, or three, speeches, he was obliged to give it up, and had
to ask the indulgence of the audience, and beg of them to accept Mr.
Ryder, as his substitute. He lived some years afterwards, till 11th
July 1797&mdash;when he died, at the age of 98.</p>

<p><i>Bannister</i> began his theatrical career at the early age of 12. At
his engagement at Drury Lane, in 1779, he played tragedy, but, after
the death of Edwin, he supplied his place, and played Comedy. He died
8th Nov. 1836, aged 76. <i>Incledon</i> was the sweetest singer of his
time, and made his debut at Covent Garden in 1790&mdash;Died 1826.
<i>Elliston</i> first appeared in London, at the Haymarket in 1796.
Although he was not a famous actor, he cannot be omitted from a list
of theatrical celebrities. Then, too, among the lesser stars, were
<i>Barrymore</i>, <i>Ryder</i>, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page189" name="page189"></a>(p. 189)</span> <i>Johnstone</i>, <i>Pope</i>, <i>Holman</i> and
<i>Munden</i>&mdash;not even forgetting <i>Delpini</i> the famous Clown, and
Scaramouch.</p>

<p class="caption">The Theatre.</p>
</div>

<p>Among the chief actresses, was <i>Mrs. Jordan</i>, whose real name was
Dorothy Bland, who became a decided favourite, with a London audience,
at her first appearance at Drury Lane, in 1785. Her connection with
the Duke of Clarence, afterwards William 4th, is well known. They
lived very happily together, and had ten Children, but the connection
was broken off in 1811&mdash;and she was left to shift for herself. She
died in 1816.</p>

<p>The name of <i>Sarah Siddons</i> is too well known to elicit any remark; as
a tragedian, her equal has, probably, never been seen on an English
Stage. She had a long career&mdash;from her <em lang="fr">début</em>, at Drury Lane, in
1775, till her last appearance, in London, in 1816. Died 1831&mdash;aged
76.</p>

<p><i>Miss Farren</i>, was a most lady-like, and elegant actress. She was tall
and slim, and was caricatured as being positively scraggy&mdash;but she
captivated the then Lord Derby, who, in physique was her complete
antithesis, having short legs, a very corpulent body, and a
hydrocephalous head. She retired from the stage before her marriage,
in 1796.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Crouch</i>, and <i>Mrs. Billington</i>, the rival songstresses, were
actresses, but they generally had parts assigned them, in which they
could exercise their vocal powers, and they sang at Oratorios, and
Concerts. Mrs. Billington did not retire from her profession until
1800. She died in 1817.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Frances Abington</i> first appeared before a London audience on
21st Aug. 1755, and played, with few intermissions, until 1798. After
Mrs. Clive, she was the best comic actress on the English stage, and
could equally <span class="pagenum"><a id="page190" name="page190"></a>(p. 190)</span> play Lady Teazle, Lady Betty Modish, a
Chambermaid, a Romp, or a Country girl&mdash;Died, 1815.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Bellamy</i>, can just claim a notice, because she died in 1788, but
she left the stage in 1785. She was a tragic actress, and was reckoned
equal to <i>Mrs. Cibber</i>.</p>

<p>Chief among the next rank of actresses, we must place <i>Miss Brunton</i>,
<i>Mrs. Martyr</i>, and <i>Mrs. Pope</i>.</p>

<p>Thinking it would interest my readers, I have taken some portraits of
the chief Actors, and Actresses, of the time, from a very rare book,
and they are interesting to the present generation, as shewing the
Costumes in which the plays were acted, and, which, I suppose,
satisfied the æsthetic, and archæological, taste of our grandfathers.</p>

<p>Both audience, and press, were very outspoken in their criticisms,
and, indeed, in those days, dramatic criticism was real, and had not
been reduced to a fine art, as now. Take the following instance:&mdash;</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"Theatre, Covent Garden. Hoadley's agreeable Comedy of <cite>The
     Suspicious Husband</cite>, was, last night, in general, presented here
     with spirit, and attended by a considerable audience. The
     Character of most prominent merit, as to performance, was
     <i>Strickland</i>, which Farren supported with strong emotion, and
     probable impression. Mrs. Abington would have represented
     <i>Clarinda</i> with more effect, if she had not directed all her
     share of the dialogue entirely to the audience. Pope was the
     <i>Frankly</i>, but he must take great pains before he will acquire
     the ease necessary for genteel Comedy. Lewis's <i>Ranger</i> was not
     sufficiently marked by the appearance of that airy dissipation
     which the part demands. Mrs. Wells' <i>Jacintha</i> was only
     distinguished for rustic dialect, and awkward deportment. Mrs.
     Bernard had the merit of being decent in <cite>Mrs.
     Strickland</cite>."&mdash;(<cite>The Morning Post, Jan. 3, 1788.</cite>)</p>
</div>

<p>The Theatre, was, then, as now, a passion with <span class="pagenum"><a id="page191" name="page191"></a>(p. 191)</span> some people,
and amateur theatricals were in high favour.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"It has lately been a practice with one, or two, of the female
     performers at Drury Lane Theatre, to refuse appearing on the
     stage, though much after the time of commencing the play, because
     the boxes may not happen to be filled with fashionable visitors,

     began with the <i lang="la">Dramatis Personæ</i>, thus, 'The <em>Impostor</em>, by Mr.

     added, 'being his <em>first appearance</em> in that character.'"</p>

11, 1789</cite>.</p>

     <p>"Perdita, the once beautiful Perdita, parades, every day, along

     <p class="noindent">in hopes that her charms, which, formerly, commanded the grave

     little morning air&mdash;such a daily excursion would be more
     serviceable to her health, than an anxious ride through Pall
     Mall, can be gratifying to her pride."</p>

to behaviour at the theatres:&mdash;</p>

<div class="quote">

     turbulent, and riotous, during the last act of Henry the Fifth,
     that the performance was interrupted upwards of a quarter of an
     hour. The audience, at last, asserted their power, and turned
     them disgracefully out of the Theatre. This should always be done
     to crush the race of disgusting puppies that are a constant
     nuisance at the playhouse every night."</p>

     <p>"A box lobby puppy having insulted a gentleman at Covent Garden
     Theatre, on Friday night, received a very suitable drubbing.

<p>Fancy our modern Royal Family, on their visits to the

     performed before <i>their Majesties</i>, the three elder Princesses,
     and a very brilliant house. Some well-timed songs introduced into
     the pantomime of <em>Harlequin's Museum</em>, gave the audience an
     opportunity of testifying their loyalty to the King, and
     attachment to both her Majesty, and her family, who joined
     heartily in the choruses. We never saw them better entertained.

<div class="quote">
     <p>"Performers at the Theatres are now paid more liberally than

     <p>"The opening of the New Theatre, belonging to the Margrave of
     Anspach's Villa, at Hammersmith, took place on Thursday evening,
     with an entertainment the most costly, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page194" name="page194"></a>(p. 194)</span> and at the same
     time, the most tasty, and elegant, we ever remember to have
     witnessed. The Prince of <span class="smcap">Wales</span>, who was present, declared he had
     never seen anything more splendid, and handsomely conducted. The
     Theatre is built at a short distance from the house, between
     which there is a communication by means of a colonnade. The
     outside appearance rather resembles an old Gothic building, than
     a Temple devoted to the Muses. The inside is prettily fitted up,
     but the ceiling is too low for the size of it.</p>

     <p>"The performance opened by a prelude: after which a little piece
     was represented, entitled <span class="smcap">Fanfan and Colas</span>, the characters by the
     <span class="smcap">Margravine</span>, young <span class="smcap">Keppel Craven</span>, Mons. and Medame <span class="smcap">Texier</span>, and
     Count <span class="smcap">d'Alet</span>, <i>Lord High Chamberlain of the Household</i>. The third
     <em>petite piece</em> was a very humorous dialogue called <span class="smcap">Le Poulet</span>,
     between Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hobart</span>, as an English servant maid, and Mons. <span class="smcap">Le
     Texier</span>, as a French Valet. Both were inquisitive after news: the
     one told all the <em>chit chat</em> of the town in her English dialect:
     the other told the great exploits going forward in France, in
     French. Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hobart</span> played her part to admiration, and very aptly
     introduced, among other things, the story of her own public
     <em>Fete</em>, last summer, at Ham, where the torrents of rain poured
     down, in such abundance, as to turn all her fine creams into poor
     milk and water.</p>

     <p>"The supper, after the play, was magnificent in the extreme, and
     consisted of a profusion of all the delicacies of the season.
     Besides Soups, and every dainty meat, there were pine apples, new
     grapes, cherries, strawberries, &amp;c.</p>

     <p>"After the supper, there was a Masquerade, and Ball, which was
     quite unexpected to the Company. The Margravine had provided new
     dresses for all the company, and the Ladies, and Gentlemen, each
     dressed in separate rooms. The Duke of <span class="smcap">Clarence</span> changed his dress
     seven different times, and greatly added to the hilarity of the
     entertainment. The <span class="smcap">Prince</span> was in a domino."&mdash;(<cite>Times, April 27,
     1793.</cite>)</p>

     Mrs. <span class="smcap">Holman</span> (the <em>ci-devant</em> Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hughes</span>) who made her debut in
     Dublin, some years since, has a priority to public notice on this
     account: if real rank by <em>birth</em>, education, and fortune, give a
     title to distinction, if admission to the first orders of
     fashionable society have pretensions, the friends of that Lady

     <p class="p2 center">OPENING OF NEW DRURY.</p>

     <p>"Public curiosity, which has long been on the tip-toe of
     expectation, was yesterday gratified by the opening of this
     superb edifice, under the immediate management of Mr. <span class="smcap">Kemble</span>,
     whose approved talents well entitle him to so flattering a mark
     of distinction. Of this Theatre, language must be inadequate to
     give even a faint idea of the effect it produces on the
     spectator, at his <em>entré</em>: nor does the first impression in the
     least diminish from a more minute examination into its structure,
     and decorations: the whole forming a happy combination of the
     gay, and the grand. The Stage, fitted as it was for an Oratorio,
     presented a nouvelle, and pleasing, prospect. The representation
     of a Gothic Cathedral, with the 'Long sounding Isle,' and</p>

<div class="center">
<p class="poem">
  'Storied windows richly dight<br />
  Casting a dim religious light,'</p>
</div>

     <p class="noindent">was admirably adapted to suit with the solemnity appertaining to
     sacred selections.</p>

     <p>"From the opening of the doors, to the first crash of the band,
     most able in all its movements, the satisfaction and delight of
     the audience was expressed by repeated, and increasing,
     plaudits&mdash;encouraged not a little by the care, and attention,
     evinced by the Proprietors, for the convenience of the public, in
     the approaches to the House&mdash;in every respect answering to the
     magnificence, and accommodation, within. Independent of the
     attraction, long, very long, to be expected from the novelty, as
     well as beauty, of the <span class="smcap">New Drury</span>, some <span class="pagenum"><a id="page196" name="page196"></a>(p. 196)</span> credit ought to
     be given to that which must ever have its weight with the people
     at large, as well as amateurs&mdash;a numerous, and well appointed,
     set of <span class="smcap">vocal</span> performers. The names of <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>, <span class="smcap">Storace</span>, <span class="smcap">Kelly</span>,
     <span class="smcap">Crouch</span>, and <span class="smcap">Dignum</span>, are too proverbial for excellence in their
     several lines, to need our eulogium. Miss <span class="smcap">Leake</span>, whose unaffected
     correctness of style, and melody of tone, must shortly place her
     deservedly high in her profession, may also be deemed almost as
     powerful an acquisition as Miss <span class="smcap">Parke</span>, at the other House. Mr.
     <span class="smcap">Meredith</span>, from Liverpool, possesses a fine deep volume of voice,
     which he exerted to great advantage. This Gentleman, we recollect
     some years since at Ranelagh, <em>and</em>, if we are not very much
     mistaken, at the Little Theatre, as the <span class="smcap">Prodigal Son</span> of <span class="smcap">Dr.
     Arnold's</span> charming Oratorio.</p>

     <p>"Giornovici's Concerto would have gone off much better, had the
     subject not been so tedious. This is a fault we have too often
     cause to find with Concerto Performers, who frequently give us
     too much of a good thing. His mode of introduction was
     particularly awkward&mdash;some other might be contrived than pitching
     him upon a plank, brought in at the hazard of discomfiting the
     head dresses, or breaking the noses of the ladies in the
     Orchestra.</p>

     <p>"The sound was rather too redundant, in general, and the language
     of the Gods, now and then, too plainly heard in the pit; but, as
     it arises merely from the freshness of the building, this
     inconvenience will gradually be amended.</p>

     <p>"The <span class="smcap">Prince of Wales</span> was with <span class="smcap">Mrs. Fitzherbert</span>, and <span class="smcap">Mr. Sheridan</span>,
     in the box appropriated to his Royal Highness. Lord <span class="smcap">Thurlow</span> sat,
     apparently well pleased, in the box beneath. Mr. and Mrs. <span class="smcap">Kemble</span>,
     Mrs. <span class="smcap">Siddons</span>, and Sir <span class="smcap">Francis Bourgeois</span>, saw that all was well,
     in one of the orchestra boxes.</p>

     <p>"From the frequent <em>encores</em>, the Selection was not over till a
     late hour. The usual cry of 'take care of your pockets' on
     quitting the Theatre, was superfluous: for <i>Townsend</i> attended to
     keep a 'wary eye;' so the pickpockets, of course, found it
     impracticable to make any 'palpable hits.'"&mdash;(<cite>Times, March 13,

     Hon. Mrs. <span class="smcap">Twisleton</span> was at the Ball-room, and stood up to dance:
     she stickled a little for <em>precedence</em> as an <em>Honorable</em>: the

     as a <em>Public Performer</em>. Her partner instanced a Performer, <span class="smcap">M.
     Yanievitz</span>, who was in the constant habit of appearing there. The
     Master of the Ceremonies went up to this amiable, and
     distinguished, foreigner, and intimated that his appearance there
     was thought too frequent, by the Subscribers. Mr. <span class="smcap">Yanievitz</span>,
     demanded who had given the Master of Ceremonies this intimation:
     a satisfaction which was refused. Next morning Mr. <span class="smcap">Yanievitz</span>

     upon this occasion.</p>

     <p class="p2">Drury Lane Theatre has not experienced a riot so wild, and
     unappeasable, as that of Tuesday evening, since the <em>Blackamoor
     Washed White</em>, of famous memory. The Entertainments <span class="pagenum"><a id="page199" name="page199"></a>(p. 199)</span>
     advertised for the night's amusements were <em>three</em>. The
     <em>Smugglers</em>, having nothing contraband on board, was not only
     suffered to pass, but was hailed with three cheers:&mdash;The <em>Virgin
     Unmasked</em> had her admirers&mdash;but the <em>Deserter</em> was mauled most
     dreadfully&mdash;for Young <span class="smcap">Welsh</span> had permitted a new <em>Skirmish</em> to
     make his <em>debut</em>, as <em>Suett</em> phrased it: and, being a miserable
     wretch, when the audience expressed a disapprobation, the
     Performers, to shorten the ridicule, shortened the scenes, which
     on such occasions, is usual, and prudent&mdash;but, the curtain
     dropping at ten minutes past ten, created a violent burst of
     indignation. <span class="smcap">Kelly</span> first attempted to enquire the wishes of <i>John
     Bull</i>, and expressed himself, in the name of the Performers,
     ignorant of how he was disobliged. All striving to be heard,
     none, of course, could be so, and he retired. Uproar still
     increased, and, after near half an hour of this din, <span class="smcap">Suett</span> made
     his appearance, and apologised for the badness of the stage
     struck hero, but he was soon given to understand, that that was
     not the cause of the <em>Row</em>, but that the audience expected to
     have the "Deserter" played <em>wholly</em> over again. Mr. S., after
     "looking as queer as a quartern of soap after a week's wash,"
     expressed his concern that many of the Performers were gone, and
     the stage lights out, but this was the cause of fresh howlings,
     and as somebody cried out, 'God save the King,' he promised to
     send as many of the Orchestra, as could be found. In five minutes
     this popular hymn was received with acclamation. The curtain drew
     up, and all the Performers in the Theatre sung it. The curtain
     again dropt amid violent tumults which continued, and increased.
     Again Mr. <span class="smcap">Suett</span> appeared, and declared 'how much hurt the
     Proprietors were at any part of the Performance being omitted:
     that it was without their concurrence, or even knowledge, and
     that such a circumstance should never happen again.' This rather
     mollified the audience, and many dispersed at a quarter past 11.
     Almost the whole of the lights in the house had been long
     extinguished: and some of the benches were torn up."&mdash;(<cite>Times,

first 60 nights. It was <span class="pagenum"><a id="page203" name="page203"></a>(p. 203)</span> produced at Drury Lane Theatre, on 2
Ap. 1796, Kemble, playing Vortigern. He was an unbeliever in the
authenticity of the MS., and, certainly, did not attempt to uphold it
by his acting. In fact he burst the bubble, altogether, in the fifth
Act, by emphasising, with much meaning, the words, "And when this
solemn mockery is o'er," that the audience caught at it, and, amidst a
chorus of yells, and hisses, the play was utterly condemned. W. H.
Ireland soon afterwards confessed all his forgeries.</p>

<p>If there were good Actors, in those days, there were also good
singers, traditions of whom have lasted until our time. Of course,
they were fewer than the Actors, because there was but one Opera&mdash;and
the operas, then in vogue, required but a very limited number of
artists.</p>

<p>Still, the names of several of the <em>prime donne</em> are yet remembered,
and the names of Mara, Storace, and Crouch will always live in the
annals of song.</p>

<p><i>Elizabeth Mara</i>, whose maiden name was Schmelling, was born at Cassel
in 1750. She commenced her musical education by playing on the violin,
but, subsequently, finding she had a good voice, she devoted herself
to its cultivation, and so far succeeded, as even to earn unqualified
approbation, and applause, from Frederick the Great&mdash;who was, as a
rule, absolutely indifferent to Music. She first came to England, in
1784, and chiefly resided here till 1802; when she retired to Moscow,
where she had property, which, however, was destroyed at the French
Invasion, and destruction of the city, in 1812, and she was reduced to
poverty. She then went to reside at Revel, where her old friends
kindly helped to support her. She came once more to London, in 1819,
and gave a Concert&mdash;but her voice was gone, and this was her last
effort. She went back to Revel, where she died, in 1833, aged 84.</p>

singer, and was universally popular. She died in 1814.</p>

<p>Of <i>Mrs. Crouch</i>, née Phillips, I have already written, slightly, as
an Actress. She was born in 1763, and went early on the stage, making
her début, at Drury Lane, in the play of "The Lord of the Manor," in
1780, so that she was but 17. In 1784, she went to Ireland, where her
admirers were numerous, and some most passionate. One young man, whose
affection she did not return, declared he would shoot both her, and
himself&mdash;and went to the theatre, ostensibly to carry out his threat,
but he was ejected from the building, and, ultimately, left the
country.</p>

<p>But there was, about this time, a very romantic episode in her life.
She was loved by a young man, heir to a title, and fortune, and she
returned his love. Naturally, under the circumstances, his family had
higher matrimonial aims for him, so the young people had no other
course open to them, than a clandestine Marriage. They were even
before the Altar, of a Roman Catholic Chapel, but the priest refused
to marry them, on hearing the name of the bridegroom, unless he had
his father's consent. No priest could be found to marry them, for the
lover was under age, so the love lorn couple eloped, hoping, at some
seaside port to find a ship for Scotland. They were followed by both
irate fathers, Mr. Phillips having informed the other. The lovers were
separated, but history is silent as to whether they ever met again.</p>

<p>After she got over this disappointment, which took some time, she
married Lieutenant Crouch of the Navy,&mdash;good <span class="pagenum"><a id="page206" name="page206"></a>(p. 206)</span> looking, but
dissipated, and spendthrift.&mdash;Of course the marriage was not a happy
one, and they parted:</p>

<p>Her voice was exquisitely sweet, and she was a most graceful actress.
She kept her hold on the public, and was on the stage until a short
time before her death, in 1805.</p>

<p>The names of Incledon, and Braham, have only to be mentioned, to
recall their vocal triumphs.</p>

<p><i>Benjamin Charles Incledon</i>, was the son of a surgeon&mdash;and was born at
St. Keveran, in Cornwall, in 1764. He made his first appearance, in
London, in 1790&mdash;when he played in "The poor Soldier." He, at once,
became a public favourite, and so continued until his retirement from
the stage, which was some time before his death, in 1826. His acting
was clumsy, and ungraceful, but his sweet voice rendered him
unequalled in ballad singing, which was his especial forte.</p>

<p><i>John Braham</i>, (or more correctly <i>Abraham</i>,) was born of Jewish
parents, in London, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1774. Early left an orphan, he was brought up
by Leoni, a celebrated Italian Singer, and so well taught by him, was
he, that he came out, as a public vocalist, before he was eleven years
old, when he sang <i lang="it">bravura</i> songs, which had been written for Madame
Mara. After singing, both in English, and Italian, Opera, he went to
Italy&mdash;and, after his return, he appeared at Covent Garden, in 1801.
He died in 1856.</p>

<p><i>Michael Kelly</i> was both composer, and singer, but he cannot take rank
with either Incledon, or Braham. He made his first appearance on the
stage of the Metropolis, at Drury Lane, in 1787. He composed elegant,
and pretty, airs, and he sang nicely, but many of his compositions
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page207" name="page207"></a>(p. 207)</span> are said to have had their origin in Italian, and German,
sources. This gave rise to a <em>bon mot</em> of Sheridan's, when he heard
that Kelly had turned wine merchant&mdash;he suggested that, over his door,
should be painted, "Michael Kelly, composer of wine, and importer of
music." Died 1826.</p>

</div>

<p>Far more eminent than he, as composers, were <i>Arnold</i>, <i>Shield</i>,
<i>Storacé</i>, <i>Linley</i>, and <i>Jackson</i>.</p>

<p><i>Samuel Arnold</i>, Mus. Doc., was born in 1740&mdash;and had the advantage of
studying music under Nares. He was, during his lifetime, both organist
to the King, and to Westminster Abbey, wrote several Oratorios, and
published selections of sacred music&mdash;but it is as a composer for the
theatre, that we have to consider him. When only twenty-three years of
age, he was appointed composer to Covent Garden Theatre, and his
earliest operas were there produced. In 1776, he filled the same
position with regard to the Haymarket, and this versatile genius
composed Operas, and Oratorios, until his death in 1802.</p>

<p><i>William Shield</i> (born in 1754) carved his own way up to the eminence,
which he enjoyed, in his profession. Apprenticed to a boatbuilder, he
gave up that business, as soon as he was out of his time: and, being
musical, and, playing well on the violin, he soon obtained a situation
at Scarborough, as leader of Concerts there, and gained such a
reputation, that he was offered, and accepted, the position of first
Viola, at the Italian Opera House. His first theatrical work was
composing the Music, (in 1778), to "The Flitch of Bacon." He wrote the
music for many other plays&mdash;and, on the death of Sir W. Parsons, he
gained the appointment of "Master of his Majesty's Musicians in
ordinary." He died in 1829.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page208" name="page208"></a>(p. 208)</span> In spite of his foreign name, Stephen Storacé, was born in
England, although of Italian parentage. He was early sent to Italy,
and studied at the Conservatorio of St. Onophris, at Naples, in 1787,
being then 24 years of age. He returned to England, and, soon
afterwards, was appointed Composer to Drury Lane; and, up to his
death, in 1796, he was actively engaged on Operas, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Thomas Linley</i> received his musical education from Chilcott, the
organist at Bath. One of his daughters, Eliza, married Sheridan, and,
soon after the production of his first theatrical essay, "The Duenna,"
he became joint patentee, with his son-in-law, in Drury Lane Theatre,
and, leaving Bath, went to reside in London. There, he wrote for the
Stage, and composed many operas, besides songs, madrigals, &amp;c. He
received a severe shock, when his son was drowned, in 1778&mdash;and,
although he lived till 1795, he never recovered from it.</p>

<p>William Jackson (whose <i lang="la">Te Deum</i> is, or was, such a favourite), was
born, at Exeter, in 1730, and was afterwards Organist to the Cathedral
of that city. He did not write much for the Stage, preferring sacred
music, songs, and canzonets.</p>

<p>The following paragraph shows a curious state of things at the
Opera:&mdash;</p>

     <p>"Il <span class="smcap">Capriccio Dramatico</span>, considerably curtailed, on Saturday,
     again introduced Signora Negri, and her reception was again most
     flatteringly favorable. The Burletta has to boast some very

     opposition to this kind of entertainment we have never witnessed:
     and, indeed, some of the occurrences were so peculiarly

     a slap at <span class="smcap">Don Juan</span>, got a slap in the face from an enraged
     <em>amateur</em>, who, perhaps, would have been better employed in

     noise and uproar; and the scene of <span class="smcap">Hell</span>, magnificent, and

     alterations made, but, as the sense of the subscribers, as well
     as the public, seems decidedly against a repetition of this
     Opera, we have no doubt but the Manager will submit,
     respectfully, to their <em>fiat</em>&mdash;comforting himself with the
     <em>reflection</em>, that his liberal exertions deserve&mdash;though it is
     not always in the power of mortals to command&mdash;success.</p>

     <p>"The Opposition to the new Opera of <span class="smcap">Don Giovanni</span>, on Saturday
     night, is said to have been preconcerted: and it was known in the
     morning of that day that there was to be a riot. In one part of
     the Pit, the disturbance became so serious, that two Gentlemen
     called each other out, and agreed to meet, as yesterday morning.
     Sir W. H. was at the head of the opposition party. In justice to
     the Manager of the Opera, it should be recollected by those who
     are dissatisfied with the present company of performers, that the
     same unprecedented circumstances which prevented several Dancers
     from leaving France, also deterred several singers from coming
     from Italy, as they must pass through a part of France. This
     inconvenience is only of a temporary nature, and cannot be
     prevented. In the meantime, the subscribers, and the public, have
     the most magnificent, as well as the most commodious, theatre in
     Europe to resort to."&mdash;(<cite>Times, Mar. 10, 1794.</cite>)</p>

<p>The Ballet does not receive so much attention in the public press, as

<div class="quote">
     <p>"The OPERA.&mdash;The mania of expectation was, on Saturday night, at
     the very acme of curiosity. The Pit was so crowded even before
     the drawing up of the curtain, that it was not possible to edge
     another face into the area. Stars, garters, feathers, and
     turbans, were so jumbled, and intermixed, at the doors, that all
     sex and identity were indistinguishable. The stage itself was
     crammed on all sides, and in such a manner, as to render the
     shifting of the scenery 'a work of labour, and a service of
     danger.' So eager, indeed, was the desire of seeing <span class="smcap">Didelot</span> and
     <span class="smcap">Rose</span>, that the wings were crowded with Ladies. Amongst those
     Ladies who thus made their <em>first appearance</em> on the stage, we

     <span class="pagenum"><a id="page213" name="page213"></a>(p. 213)</span> fairly exhibited: but the stage was so very full, that
     figure dancers could scarce round a horse-shoe to trip in, and no
     performer could make an exit. <i>Didelot</i> and <i>Rose</i> appeared
     again in the Ballet, lugged in without character, merely to shew

<p>The length of Mdlle. Parisot's skirts would have delighted the Bishop
of Durham (Shute Barrington), who was much exercised in his mind, in
1798, as to the brevity of those worn by the ladies of the ballet. He
seems to have entered into a crusade against the ballet, before he
made his memorable speech in the House of Lords, on 2nd March,
1798&mdash;for the next illustration is dated January in that year.</p>

<p>It was, however, on the occasion of the second reading of Esten's
divorce bill, that the wrath of the Right Reverend Father in God,
fairly boiled over, and the <cite>Times</cite> of 3rd March, reports him to have
spoken thus. "He considered it a consequence of the gross
immoralities, imported of late years, into this kingdom, from France;
the Directory of which country, finding that they were not able to
subdue us by their arms, appeared as if they were determined to gain
their ends by destroying our morals. They had sent over persons to
this country, who made the most indecent exhibitions on our Theatres;
exhibitions which would not have been allowed <span class="pagenum"><a id="page214" name="page214"></a>(p. 214)</span> even in France;
and which, so far from being allowable in a Christian Country, would
have disgraced the ancient Theatres of Athens and Rome.</p>

<p>"It was his intention to move, on some future day, that an Address be
presented to his Majesty, beseeching him to order all such persons out
of the Kingdom, as people who were likely to destroy our morality, and
religion; and who were very probably, in the pay of France."</p>

<p>This tirade made him a fitting subject for the Caricaturists, and they
did not forget him.</p>

<p>In a picture by Gillray, 14th Mar. 1798, "Operatical Reform, or La
Danse à l'Evêque," we recognise Miss Rose, on the extreme right of the
three ladies, who have little other covering for their bodies but the
episcopal apron and lawn sleeves. At the foot, is this verse&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">
<p class="poem">
  "'Tis hard for such new-fangled orthodox rules,<br />
  That our Opera troupe should be blamed;<br />
  Since, like our first Parents, they only (poor fools!)<br />
  Danced naked, and were not ashamed."</p>
</div>

<p>And there was yet another amusing Caricature of the Prelate, in
connection with this subject. In July 1798, Gillray published a
picture of "More short Petticoats, or the Highland Association under
Episcopal Examination." The Bishop is accompanied by Lord Salisbury,
the then Lord Chamberlain, and inspects the Kilts of three
Highlanders, who assure him "You'll find them exactly according to the
rules of the Highland Association." But the Bishop's modesty is
blushing violently, and he replies "Don't tell me of rules, I say it's
abominable! It's about half a foot too short according to the opera
Standard. Bring the large breeches directly; why, the <em>figurantes</em>
would be ashamed of it."</p>

<p>Masquerades were introduced into England by Henry 8th, but, perhaps,
at no time were they so fashionable, as during the latter half of the
18th Century, although they do not always seem to have been
successful. The <cite>Morning Post</cite>, Feb. 6, 1788, speaks of a Masquerade
at the Opera House, thus:&mdash;"The Supper and Wines were consistent with
the well known parsimonious principle of the conductor, the provision
being very unequal to the <em>appetite</em>, and <em>number</em>, of the guests. The
music was very indifferent." Thus we see that these amusements were
not of equal quality, and the Critics did not fear to say what they
thought of them.</p>

     <p class="p2 center">"The MASQUERADE.</p>

     <p>"The entertainment given by the Manager of the <span class="smcap">Opera House</span>, on
     Monday night, was the best attended of any we have seen for many
     years, and fully answered the expectations that had been formed
     of it. The space allotted, however, large as it was, with the
     addition of the new room, and another above stairs, was by no
     means sufficient for so large a company: and the pressure of the
     crowd rendered the rooms insufferably hot, as well as prevented
     the masks from appearing to advantage. For so large an assembly,
     there were fewer masks than usual, but the hilarity of the
     company made amends for this deficiency. The Prince of <span class="smcap">Wales</span> was
     in a black domino, arm-in-arm with Captain <span class="smcap">Churchill</span>, and Lord
     <span class="smcap">George Conway</span>; the Duke of <span class="smcap">Clarence</span> was the whole evening with
     Mrs. <i>Jordan</i> in a private box upstairs. <i>Michael Angelo Taylor</i>
     was dressed in women's cloaths, but was less talkative than
     usual. The supper was extremely well conducted, and the
     provisions better than usual. The refreshments were also
     liberally supplied. There were about 2700 persons in the rooms,
     and among them some of the prettiest women in town."&mdash;(<cite>Times,
     March 5, 1794.</cite>)</p>

     <p class="p2 center">"MASQUERADE AT THE OPERA HOUSE.</p>

     <p>"On Thursday night, for the first time this season, there was a
     grand masquerade at this House, which was very numerously
     attended, as every room was crowded, and the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page217" name="page217"></a>(p. 217)</span> numbers
     computed at about 1600. A party of <em>Bon-vivans</em>, unmasked, came
     into the rooms about two o'clock, who had evidently made too free
     use of the juice of the grape. The primitive dress of one of
     them, who appeared to be a Quaker, did not quite accord with his
     manners, which were more prone to the flesh than the spirit.
     Although the new regulations in price is in favour of
     Masquerades, yet the freedom of conversation which is allowed in
     these motley meetings, became, on this occasion, indecent
     ribaldry, and licentiousness. The <em>lowness</em> of the price of
     admission was in a great measure the cause of introducing many
     <em>low</em> visitors, who made themselves obnoxious to delicacy, and
     good manners, by the coarsest language."&mdash;(<cite>Times, Feb. 17,

<p class="caption">Madame Cornelys.</p>
</div>

<p>There is a paragraph in the <cite>Times</cite> of August 23, 1797, whereby "hangs
a tale"&mdash;</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"The miserable death of Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cornelys</span>, in the Fleet Prison, adds
     another melancholy instance to the catalogue of vicissitudes in
     what is generally termed <em>fashionable life</em>. She was formerly the
     law-giver of the circles of dissipation, and gaiety, yet closed
     her existence in the hospital room of the prison, in which she
     had obtained permission to reside, by the kindness of the
     Warden."</p>
</div>

<p>The history of Teresa Cornelys is very singular, showing how a
nobody&mdash;for no one knows even from what part of Germany she
came&mdash;could come here, and, by her business qualities, and tact,
become a person absolutely indispensable to Society. All we know of
her is that she was supposed to be a German, who had been a public
singer, both in France, and Germany, and that she came over here about
1756 or 1757. Whether there was a Herr Cornelys alive, we have no
knowledge&mdash;but she had a son, and daughter. That she was not bad
looking, is evidenced by her portrait, which must have been taken in
her declining years: that she must have <span class="pagenum"><a id="page218" name="page218"></a>(p. 218)</span> been shrewd,
business-like, and possessed of much <em lang="fr">savoir faire</em>, is
undeniable&mdash;for she held "Society" in her grasp, and, for a time, made
it do just what she wanted.</p>

<p>What she did for the first five, or six years, after her coming to
England is not known, but she must have been possessed of some
Capital, or she could not have taken, as she did, Carlisle House&mdash;a
mansion in Soho Square. Here she started a sort of fashionable Social
Club, called "The Society," either in 1762, or 1763, and this was its
programme. "The subscription is seven guineas for twelve nights, one
ticket each, which introduces only one person, whether gentleman, or
lady; but there are frequent subscriptions in the year, and two ladies
may be admitted six nights on one subscription. No person can be
admitted a Subscriber to this Society, but through the recommendation
of a subscriber. Four ladies of quality, having each of them a book,
have the joint management, direction, and choice, of the subscribers;
every one's name must be entered in one of those ladies' books.</p>

<p>"A non-subscriber can only be admitted by a subscriber's ticket,
writing his, or her name on the back; in consequence of which rule,
and to avoid the possibility of improper company, their names are,
immediately after the night is over, printed, and hung up in the outer
room.</p>

<p>"The doors are opened, at 9 o'clock, of the lower rooms, which consist
of six, each superior to the other; few people, however, assemble
before 10, and those who profess themselves of the genteelest order,
not till eleven, when they walk about, and amuse themselves with
accosting their acquaintance, and forming themselves <span class="pagenum"><a id="page219" name="page219"></a>(p. 219)</span> into
select parties for the evening; then regaling with jellies, syllabubs,
cakes, orgeat, lemonade, fruits, &amp;c., prepared in a kind of arched
shelving all round the hangings of the tea room.</p>

<p>"At ten, the upper flight of rooms open, which consist of two large
rooms, besides a very large ball room, furnished, and hung, in the
most superb taste, with an exceeding good band of music in an
orchestra erected at the upper end, and rows of benches, down the
sides, placed one above the other. In this room they dance country
dances, but no minuets at all.</p>

<p>"At half-past eleven, the company in general repair to tea, and have
small round tables for their separate parties.</p>

<p>"At twelve, the Cotillion gallery opens, with another range of seven
rooms underground, which, from the vast variety of furniture and
ornaments, the grandeur, and magnificence, of some, the elegant
simplicity of others, together with the amazing beauty of the lights,
one of the principal excellencies of the whole, form a view, on
descending a perpendicular flight of stairs most sumptuously, and
pleasingly, striking.</p>

<p>"In these lower range of rooms, the company finish the evening, the
young in dancing cotillions, the others in looking on; for there are
no cards, nor gaming, of any kind. At one, the company begin to
separate, and continue going till four, but the major part break up
about two."</p>

<p>By which set of rules we see that Madame Cornelys, started her
establishment in the strictest propriety, whatever became of it
afterwards; and these rules were strictly carried out. The rooms, on
off nights, were used for other purposes; for instance, she, knowing
the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page220" name="page220"></a>(p. 220)</span> power of the class, gave a servants' ball; and the Old
Westminster scholars held their Anniversary Meeting in her rooms.</p>

<p>Her prosperity excited envy, and many were the rumours set afloat, to
her detriment. For instance, in 1766, it was said she owed her late
cook £50, and that she had run away from her ruined creditors, to
France, with many thousand pounds.</p>

<p>She had to contradict these reports, and said that she had, within
thirteen months, spent £11,000, on the house, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Concerts, both instrumental and vocal, were given at Carlisle House,
and the tickets for them, which survive, are very beautiful, many of
them being drawn by Cipriani, and engraved by Bartolozzi.</p>

<p>The Royal Family used to patronise her <em lang="fr">soirées</em>, as did also the King
of Denmark, when he visited England in 1768.</p>

<p>Early in 1770, she gave her first Masquerade, which immediately
lowered the tone of her establishment, and was the precursor of her
downfall. This was under the patronage of the "Tuesday Night's Club,"
and the Dukes of Gloucester, and Cumberland&mdash;besides numbers of the
aristocracy of both sexes, were present, and it was a very brilliant
affair.</p>

<p>She had another grand Masquerade on 6 February 1771, to which the
price of admission was two and a half guineas. The same Royalty was
present, and also the leading Nobility&mdash;Among the masques were five
devils, a bear, and, worst of all bad taste, a shrouded corpse in a
coffin, (said to be a brother of Colonel Luttrell), but he was, after
a short time, ejected by some pseudo sailors.</p>

<a id="img079" name="img079"></a>
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/img079.jpg" width="450" height="305" alt="" title="The Female Coterie." />
<p class="caption">The Female Coterie.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page221" name="page221"></a>(p. 221)</span> From this time her fortunes declined&mdash;she was twice fined £50
for performing Operas, under the guise of harmonic meetings, and
Guadagni, her principal vocalist, had been fined £50 for singing in
the same, and these musical performances were put a stop to.</p>

<p>But, in spite of all her enemies could do to her, she still had some
friends, if we can believe the <cite>London Chronicle</cite>, 19-21 February
1771.</p>

<p>"A certain D&mdash;&mdash;s, who is a principal promoter of the New Opera
House, declared, lately, she would persist in support of Mrs. C.,
whatever was the consequence, 'for,' said she, 'I hate the thoughts of
mixing with any body merely because they have half a guinea in their
pocket; and that such scums should sit on the same bench, and think
themselves on a level with the first nobility!' 'I agree with you'
(says Lady A&mdash;&mdash;r), 'and am grieved to think that we are, one day or
other to mix in heaven with the dregs of the people.' 'God forbid'
(says the D&mdash;&mdash;s), 'I should ever be in such company.'"</p>

<p>The Subscription balls, and Masquerades still went on&mdash;and she
instituted a society called "the Coterie," which had not the
reputation of insisting on the strictest morality on the part of its
members.</p>

<p>This <em>coterie</em> broke up. The Pantheon was built, and opened, in
opposition to her. Perhaps she was extravagant, but, anyhow, from some
cause or other, she became bankrupt, and was so gazetted on the 9th
Nov. 1772, as a "chapwoman, and dealer in gloves." Her goods were sold
in Dec. 1772, and it must have been a famous sale, as the Catalogues,
to admit two, were five shillings each.</p>

<p>She, herself, was taken to a debtor's prison, where <span class="pagenum"><a id="page222" name="page222"></a>(p. 222)</span> she could
not have stopped very long, as there are advertisements of
Masquerades conducted by her, at Carlisle House, in the spring and
summer of 1773.</p>

<p>She was again a bankrupt in Dec. 1774, and Carlisle House was
advertised to be sold. Still, somehow or other, she must have found
friends, with money, to help her, for she issued an advertisement, 15
January 1776. "Mrs. Cornelys most respectfully takes the liberty to
acquaint the nobility, and gentry, that, through the kind assistance
of her friends, she is again reinstated in Carlisle House, on her own
account."</p>

<p>But nothing could bring back her old patrons, and the social status of
her masked balls got lower and lower. Worse than all, the refreshments
were not so plentiful as of old, as we may see in the "Citizen's
Complaint to the Priestess of Soho," which concludes thus&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">
<p class="poem">"Yet fairy scenes and preparations,<br />
  With all your novel decorations,<br />
  Are diet fitter, let me tell ye,<br />
  To feed the Fancy than the Belly."</p>
</div>

<p>In 1778, Carlisle House was again to be sold, but still Madame
Cornelys, somehow, kept her clutches on it. She established an
"Academy of Sciences and Belles Lettres"&mdash;a Library with Newspapers,
&amp;c.&mdash;and a debating society, open to both Sexes. This "School of
Eloquence" collapsed in 1781. Scientific lectures, Joseph Borouwlaski,
the Polish Dwarf, and some more Masquerades, were all tried, but
without avail, to resuscitate her fallen fortunes. It was said that
she gave four and a half Masquerades, the half being accounted for, by
the fact that no license had been taken out, and the masquers were
ejected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page223" name="page223"></a>(p. 223)</span> After 1782 Carlisle House seems to have been shut up; on 28
June 1785, Christie sold the furniture, China, and other effects; and
in 1788 the old Mansion was pulled down, and what was the grand Saloon
has been altered into a Roman Catholic Chapel, St. Patrick's, Soho.</p>

<p>There is no record of Madame for some years, but we know from
Newspaper notices, that in 1792 she took a large house and grounds in
Knightsbridge Road, formerly occupied by a dealer in Asses milk, and
converted it into a "female archery."</p>

<p>Luck was against her, this failed; she was very old, had fought her
fight, and now the refuge for the remainder of her days was the Fleet
Prison. There, however, she met with kindness from friends, and help
from her daughter, who was very accomplished, and no more is heard of
her, until the paragraph in the <cite>Times</cite>, which heads this memoir.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p class="p2 center">"Masquerade at Marlboro House.</p>

     <p>"At the Duchess of Marlborough's Gala, on Wednesday evening, one
     of the principal ornaments was the <em>statute</em> of Precedency,
     elegantly illuminated, in variegated lamps over the grand
     entrance. Lyon, Clarencieux, and Garter, Kings-at-Arms, in their
     coats of office, were stationed in the hall, and marshalled the
     guests upon their arrival. Upon the first landing place, were Her
     Grace's Vice-Chamberlain, and three Masters of the Ceremonies,
     attended by deputy Masters, and the Pages of the Presence, and
     back staircase. In the antechamber, covers were provided for the
     Lord Mayor, and Sheriffs of London, whose pease were said to be
     served cold, but his Lordship eat his peaches without hazarding
     any remarks. His Mace was thought to be one of the finest pieces
     of sculpture ever executed in pastry. It contained a <span class="pagenum"><a id="page224" name="page224"></a>(p. 224)</span>
     fine pine-apple in the capital, with a beautiful crown in
     Naples-biscuit, and his chair was entirely composed of barley
     sugar drops. In the next room were the Barons and Baronesses, the
     newly created ones next the door, and the premier Baron very
     near, but not in contact with the lowest Viscount, in the
     corridor of the third chamber. The Lord Chamberlain, the Lords of
     the Bedchamber, the Gold and Silver Sticks, &amp;c., had their wands
     of the best double refined sugar, excepting the Gold Stick, whose
     staff was of barley-sugar, or as some say sugar-candy.</p>

     <p>"In the inner rooms, according to their rank, and date, were
     placed the Earls, Marquisses, and Dukes of England. The premier
     Duke, and E. M., nearest to the Noble Hostess. The Lords on the
     cross bench were served with some difficulty by <em>Beefeaters</em>, who
     were obliged to move like the Knights at Chess, which had a very
     pretty effect. It added to the liveliness, and gaiety of the
     meeting, that every mask had for its neighbour, on both hands,
     the same individual it conversed with so frequently at Mr.
     Hasting's trial, which made the 'I know you,' and 'Who are you?'
     exceedingly facetious and happy. The Lords of the Bedchamber were
     in high glee, and spirits, but were discovered by their jokes,
     some of which were remembered upon former occasions. The Maids of
     Honour were in perfect character and detected in an
     instant."&mdash;(<cite>Times, June 21, 1799.</cite>)</p>

<p>This refers only to the subscription Balls, which were so famous, and
so select&mdash;but, as I said above, this was the chiefest Concert Hall. A
greater libel against the English nation never was uttered, than when
it was said they were not a musical nation&mdash;and it was, essentially,
in Chamber music, glees, madrigals, ballads&mdash;small home concerts in
which a few friends met together and spent a pleasant evening&mdash;in
which the harpsichord, or pianoforte (for that instrument was then in
vogue), joined with the cello, violin, and flute, in pretty, and
harmonious, quartets.</p>

<p>We are apt to think that among the other advantages of progressive
Civilisation which we possess in this latter part of the 19th Century,
Commercial failures and stoppage of Banks are peculiarly our own, but
it was not so; the years 1793 and 1796&mdash;the former especially&mdash;were
times of severe mercantile depression&mdash;the tale of which is best told
in the language of the times.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"The late considerable failures in the City are no longer to be
     concealed; public credit cannot therefore, suffer the more by our
     publishing the fact. Four very considerable mercantile Houses
     have stopped payment within the last ten days: they are
     principally engaged in American West India Brokerage, and
     Insurance concerns. One house, alone, has failed for £800,000,
     and another for £500,000. It is feared that many more persons
     will become involved in these failures&mdash;as there has been a very
     extensive circulation of paper. The failures already known, are
     estimated at three millions, and it is conjectured that they will
     extend to two millions more. They have, naturally, created a
     great scarcity of cash in the City, and the Bank, as well as the
     Bankers, are extremely shy of discounting."&mdash;(<cite>Times, Feb. 28,
     1793.</cite>)</p>

     <p class="p2">"Some more very considerable failures have taken place in the
     City, within the last two or three days. A very large African
     house, at Bristol, has likewise stopped payment, and the letters
     from thence advise, that it is feared many more will
     follow."&mdash;(<cite>Times, March 10, 1793.</cite>)</p>

     <p class="p2">"The Bankers, in the City, have refused to discount any <span class="pagenum"><a id="page233" name="page233"></a>(p. 233)</span>
     more paper, for the present. The alarm on the Royal Exchange, is
     beyond conception to those who are not in business."&mdash;(<cite>Times,
     March 26, 1793.</cite>)</p>

     <p class="p2">"At the Meeting, on Monday, of the Noblemen, and Gentlemen,
     belonging to the County of Northumberland, we understand that
     £340,000 was subscribed, to support the <span class="smcap">Newcastle Banks</span>, the
     Proprietors of which, are gentlemen of the first landed property,
     and known to be worth many hundred thousand pounds.</p>

     <p>"The commercial stoppages, we are sorry to learn, have at length
     reached <span class="smcap">Manchester</span>, and the most serious inconveniencies are to
     be dreaded, if some effectual support is not given to that town.
     The mischief is so much dreaded, that a committee of Gentlemen,
     of that town, have come to London, to offer securities to the
     <span class="smcap">Bank</span>, provided it will afford a temporary relief to the
     manufacturers who reside there."&mdash;(<cite>Times, April 18, 1793.</cite>)</p>

     <p class="p2 center">"<span class="smcap">Public Credit.</span></p>

     <p>"The very depressed state of the public credit of the country, is
     now so universally known, and felt, that it cannot suffer any
     additional injury by our stating the fact, and the means which
     are about to be carried into effect, as an experiment of relief.
     We daily hear of new stoppages among persons, many of whom have
     ever been considered as men of large real property: on a very
     minute, and fair, enquiry into the truth of this supposition, we
     have the best reason to believe that the fact is so; and that a
     very large proportion of mercantile houses, which have been,
     lately, obliged to suspend their payments, is still solvent, and
     well able to pay every demand, in the course of time. At
     Manchester, Liverpool, and other large trading towns,
     particularly at the former, this fact is well authenticated; but
     the failures at the country banks have stopped the circulation of
     money so suddenly, that present engagements have not been able to
     be fulfilled. To adopt a remedy, if possible, at this very
     alarming state of public credit, a meeting was held at Mr. <span class="smcap">Pitt's</span>
     house, in Downing Street, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page234" name="page234"></a>(p. 234)</span> on Monday last, to consult on
     the business. The grievance being explained to Mr. <span class="smcap">Pitt</span>, he
     assured the Gentlemen of his anxiety, and readiness to give every
     assistance, in his power, to the mercantile interest, and he
     requested they would consult among themselves, and form some
     specific proposition, for his consideration. A meeting was
     accordingly held, yesterday morning, at the Mansion-house, to
     consider of the plan which should be proposed to Mr. Pitt. The
     number of gentlemen was reduced to 11, as being more convenient:
     and, at nine o'clock last night, they waited on the Minister, to
     obtain his approbation.</p>

     <p>"We do not take upon us to state, <span class="smcap">OFFICIALLY</span>, the nature of the
     plan which has been proposed, but we are led to believe that the
     outlines of it are as follows: 'That four millions of Exchequer
     Bills should be issued for the support of public credit, as a
     loan to the mercantile interest; that the security required,
     should be on goods actually warehoused, and the advance to be
     made on two-thirds of their value. Commissioners to be appointed
     to superintend the securities, and the value of the merchandise.
     The Exchequer Bills to be called in as they become redeemed. The
     borrowers to be answerable for any loss in the discount of them.'
     The plan was left for Mr. Pitt's consideration, who is to give
     his answer this morning. Should he approve of it, it is probable
     he will propose some resolution upon it, this day, in the House
     of Commons, to the end that the relief may be as speedy as
     possible."&mdash;(<cite>Times, April 24, 1793.</cite>)</p>

     <p class="p2">"The <span class="smcap">Funds</span> continued falling yesterday, and <span class="smcap">Consols</span> were below

     losers."&mdash;(<cite>Times, July 15, 1796.</cite>)</p>

     <p class="p2">"We yesterday mentioned our expectation that there would be

     declared a defaulter at the Stock Exchange. His differences are
     upon near half a million of Stock, which he had purchased at 67

<p>In 1796, there was an extraordinary scarcity of silver, which taxed
severely, the resources of the Government to meet. The difficulty was
met, to some extent, by the issue of Spanish Dollars, taken from
Prizes, and stamped <span class="pagenum"><a id="page236" name="page236"></a>(p. 236)</span> at the Tower, where the Mint then was,
with a small head of the King.&mdash;These were issued at 4s. 9d. each&mdash;The
same scarcity arose in 1803-4, and the same expedient was resorted
to&mdash;only then the dollars were issued at a price over their value, so
as to offer no premium for their destruction.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"So great is the scarcity, and high price of silver, that the
     silver smiths give 5s. 3d. for a crown piece, and a premium is

     <p class="p2">"<em>Silver</em> is so exceedingly scarce, that there is not a
     sufficient quantity, for exchange, in the channels of business,
     either good, or bad, and yet we are sorry to observe (which we
     have repeatedly) the number of unfortunate victims who are, every
     Session, brought to trial, for coining. Surely the wisdom of the
     Legislature might prevent this evil, by issuing a sufficient
     quantity for the purposes of circulation."&mdash;(<cite>Times, Sept. 15,
     1796.</cite>)</p>

     <p class="p2">"The distress for want of Silver, is daily, more and more felt
     among the trading parts of the Metropolis. These are put to the
     greatest inconvenience, for want of a greater circulation; and,
     we understand that those who have many men in their employ, are
     obliged to give one per cent., to procure it. The many complaints
     which are made, on this subject, induces us to hope that the
     issue of a fresh coinage, from the Mint, will speedily take
     place. The want of it has another bad effect, as it increases the
     coining of base half-pence."&mdash;(<cite>Times, Sept. 29, 1796.</cite>)</p>

     <p class="p2">"Yesterday, the Committee of Bankers had another Meeting at Mr.
     <span class="smcap">Pitt's</span>, to request his interference in procuring them a certain
     quantity of specie, for the demands of their business. The
     Minister returned for answer, that he could only assist them, at
     present, with 50,000 guineas: which, being divided among all the
     Bankers, will not amount to 1000 guineas for each House.</p>

     may not become an object of traffic: their intrinsic worth is
     above 4s. 6d., and they should, therefore, be issued at some
     higher price, in order that they may not be hoarded.</p>

     <p>"There can be no doubt whatever, but that large sums of specie
     have been drawn out of the <span class="smcap">Bank</span>, and concealed in the houses, or
     gardens, of private persons. As this stoppage of general
     circulation is highly prejudicial to the Public Weal, we have
     only to observe to such persons, that their extreme, and foolish
     timidity, may produce, to themselves, the very consequences they
     seek to avert: and that, instead of being richer, they may fall
     the first victims of their alarms. Wherever large sums of money
     are privately deposited, except it is with those whose occupation
     it is to hold it, such persons are likely to be the first objects
     of popular revenge. The <span class="smcap">Bank</span>, or the houses of <span class="smcap">Bankers</span>, are the

     Stamp, which it is impossible for a common observer to detect.
     Since their first issue, many chests of dollars have been
     imported into this country, for the sole purpose of forging the
     stamp. As they are circulated at 4s. 9d., and their value is only
     4s. 2d., it has afforded too great a temptation to be resisted.
     Besides the vast number of copper dollars coined, it is supposed
     that more than half of those in circulation, are counterfeited in

     a plate, with a one pound note engraved, on one side of it, and a
     two pound note, on the other; together with a number of notes
     just struck off, but not filled up. On his examination he
     confessed the fact, and thereby impeached his brother, who, he
     said, was then in Yorkshire: and acknowledged that they had

     will give bad, but not take them at present. If the traveller
     objects, he is abused and kept waiting, perhaps ten minutes, for
     change of 6d.: the coffee-house waiters say they have no others,
     and that they give and take; the haberdashers fold the change up
     in a clean bit of paper, which when opened, contains the worst of

<p class="p2 center">"FALSE COINAGE.</p>

<p>"The numerous evils arising from the now general circulation of
     Base Money, are too well known, to make it necessary that they
     should be dwelt on by us. We have always considered the different
     Administrations of this Country, as highly blameable for not
     paying more attention, than they have done, to prevent the
     nefarious practices which are introduced in the introduction of
     almost every species of Counterfeit Coin into the circulation of
     the country, because it certainly has the means in its own power,
     of lessening the mischief, by issuing a new coinage, particularly
     of Halfpence, which are, now, so generally bad, and so
     profligately circulated, that scarce a good halfpenny is to be
     seen.... The vast increase, and the extensive circulation, of
     base Money, particularly of late years, ... almost exceeds
     credibility, and the dexterity, and ingenuity, of these criminal
     people have enabled them to <span class="pagenum"><a id="page242" name="page242"></a>(p. 242)</span> finish the different kinds
     of counterfeit Money, in so masterly a manner, that it has become
     extremely difficult, for the common observer, to distinguish the
     base Coin, now in circulation, from the worn out Silver, from the
     Mint. And, so systematic has this nefarious traffic become, that
     the great dealers, who in most instances are the employers of the
     Coiners, execute orders for the Town, and Country, with the same
     regularity as other manufacturers in fair branches of trade.
     Scarce a waggon, or coach, departs from the metropolis, that does
     not carry boxes, and parcels, of base coin, to the camps,
     seaports, and manufacturing towns, insomuch, that the country is
     deluged with counterfeit Money. In London, regular markets, in
     various public, and private, houses, are held by the principal
     Dealers, where Hawkers, Pedlars, fraudulent Horse-dealers,
     Unlicensed Lottery Office Keepers, Gamblers at Fairs, Itinerant
     Jews, Irish Labourers, Servants of Toll Gatherers, and
     Hackney-Coach Owners, fraudulent Publicans, Market Women, Rabbit
     Sellers, Fish Cryers, Barrow Women, and many who would not be
     suspected, are regularly supplied with counterfeit Copper, and
     Silver, with the advantages of nearly 100 per cent. in their
     favour: and thus it happens, that through these various channels,
     immense quantities of base Money get into circulation, while an
     evident diminution of the Mint Coinage, is apparent to every
     common observer.... Discoveries have been recently made, of no
     less than 120 persons, in the metropolis, and the country, who
     are employed, principally, in coining, and selling, Base Money:
     and this, independent of the numerous horde of utterers, who
     chiefly support themselves by passing it at its full value.</p>

<p>"It will scarcely be credited, that of these criminal people who
     have either been detected, prosecuted, or convicted, within the
     last seven years, there stand upon the register of the Solicitor
     of the Mint, no less than 608 names! and yet the evil increases
     rapidly. And when it is known, that two persons can finish from
     £200, to £300, in base silver, <em>in six days</em>, and that three
     people, within the same period will stamp the like amount, in
     Copper, and when the number of known coiners are taken into the
     calculation, the aggregate in the course of the year must be
     immense!"&mdash;(<cite>Times, Oct. 5, 1796.</cite>)</p>

<h2><span class="pagenum"><a id="page243" name="page243"></a>(p. 243)</span> LAW AND POLICE.</h2>

<p>In treating the above heading, I have no wish to introduce the
"Newgate Calendar" element into this book. Let those who like such
literature, consult that work&mdash;and, doubtless, they will be rewarded
for their pains; but, in going through these old papers, much that is
curious is met with, which throws light on the manners, and customs,
of our forefathers.</p>

<p>Of Police, as we understand the word, there was none&mdash;and the
parochial Constables, and watchmen, who were supposed to guard the
premises of the rate payers, and to keep the peace, were veritably of
the Dogberry and Verges type&mdash;utterly useless for the detection, or
suppression, of crime, and only fit to "comprehend all vagrom man," or
lead some roysterer home.</p>

<p>All day long they were not; but, at night, they came out with the
bats, and owls, armed with a long staff, and a lantern, periodically
droning out the hour of the night, and the state of the weather. This
was done with the laudable intention of shewing their vigilance, but
it must equally have acted in an opposite direction, for every thief
must have had due warning of the watchman's whereabouts. They had
temporary shelters, larger than the Military Sentry box, and the wild
spirits of those days delighted to catch a watchman napping, and
overturn his box, thus temporarily incapacitating him from <span class="pagenum"><a id="page244" name="page244"></a>(p. 244)</span>
giving an alarm, or following their flight. For the former purpose
they used huge rattles, smaller specimens of which were carried, for
the same purpose, by our own Metropolitan Police, until 1884.</p>

<p>Each parish looked after its own interests, had its own watch and
ward, and was mightily jealous of interference from another parish&mdash;an
arrangement evidently very much to the advantage of a thief. People
were always grumbling&mdash;but the state of things was never altered. Hear
what they said about it in 1788:&mdash;</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"The <span class="smcap">Decrepid old Dotards</span>, to whose vigilance the different
     Vestries have confined their fellow Citizens, are likely to
     profit from the order of nature being reversed by the life of our
     modern nobility, who, rising at <em>two</em>, dining at <em>eight</em>, and
     paying afternoon visits at <em>midnight</em>, have superseded the
     necessity of having watchmen, and are, in fact, with their
     servants, a much better patrole than any of the Bow Street
     Justices could furnish."&mdash;(<cite>Morning Post, April 21, 1788.</cite>)</p>
</div>

<p>There were amateur thief catchers like Jonathan Wild, men who would be
the companions, and confederates, of Highwaymen, Housebreakers, and
Thieves, drawing Money from them until they were sucked dry, and then
sacrifice them without an atom of remorse.</p>

<p>And there were the detectives of that time, the Bow Street Runners, or
Robin Red breasts as they were called, from their wearing red
waistcoats. Peter Pindar sang of them, especially of the three that
were detailed for the protection of the Royal family at the time of
the French Revolution.</p>

<p>Townsend, was undoubtedly the sharpest of the three, but he was a
pushing, boastful fellow, and never hid his light under a bushel. He
was, however, courageous, and never heeded where he went, or what odds
were opposed to him; so that the criminal classes began to respect
him, and, at last, never thought of opposing him. He was extremely
natty in his dress, and his flaxen wig was as well known, as his short

<p>It was by his means, that the famous pickpocket, Barrington, was

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page246" name="page246"></a>(p. 246)</span> The laws were then frightfully severe in their punishments,
but this severity did not act as a deterrent to crime. The punishment
of death, (and hanging was the punishment for many trivial crimes)
seems to have had no terror&mdash;for we read in the <cite>Morning Post</cite>, July
11th 1788, "The number of Capital Convicts at present in Newgate is
eighty-one!" Of course, these were not all executed, some having their
sentences commuted to transportation for life. Let us take a few cases
from one Newspaper only, the <cite>Morning Post</cite>, September 11, 1788. It
was the Sessions at the Old Bailey, 9th September:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>Here, they evidently "caught a Tartar." The pelting could have been no
part of the man's sentence&mdash;but what was the issue of his appeal to
law, I know not.</p>

<p>About the year 1790, occurs a most singular police episode, so
singular, and so comparatively unknown, that I cannot refrain from
somewhat enlarging upon it.</p>

<p>In the early spring of 1790, murmurs began to be heard of ladies being
attacked, and stabbed, by a monster in human form. The murmurs were
low at first, and "monster" was printed with a small "m;" but, very
shortly, they grew into a roar, and no capitals were found too large
for THE MONSTER.</p>

<p>Indeed, even before that, and as far back as May, 1788, a Mrs. Smith
had been stabbed in the upper part of her thigh by a man in Fleet
Street, and was even followed by him to a house in Johnson's Court, to
which she was going, and watched by him until she was let in. In May,
1789, a Mrs. Godfrey was similarly stabbed in Boswell Court, Fleet
Street; and another lady was left wounded at her door. In March, 1790,
a Mrs. Blaney, of Bury Street, was stabbed at her door after she had
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page248" name="page248"></a>(p. 248)</span> knocked. Dr. Smith, seeing an account of this outrage in a
newspaper, inserted a notice in the <cite>Morning Herald</cite>, and that
journal, having made some severe remarks on the matter, public opinion
began to be awakened, and numerous letters were written, on the
subject, to the newspapers of the day. The thing began to be talked of
in the higher circles. A young lady named Porter had been stabbed
whilst, in the company of her sisters, returning from the Drawing Room
at St. James's, on the 18th of January, the Queen's Birthday; and
since that time, several people had been wounded by this miscreant,
who, fortunately, always failed in doing serious injury to his
victims.</p>

<p>Mr. John Julius Angerstein (whose name will ever be associated with
the commencement of our National Gallery) was very active, and
inaugurated a subscription at Lloyd's, to which the guineas flowed
merrily, for the capture, and conviction of the "Monster." The police
began to bestir themselves, and they, too, issued placards. One will
serve as a type of all:&mdash;</p>

<p>All baker's men were asked to give notice at every house they called

any man by whose instrumentality the Monster was discovered.</p>

<p>Additional publicity was, moreover, given by other means. The <cite>Morning
Herald</cite> of April 27th says:</p>

<p>"A new musical piece was produced last night at Astley's called The
Monster, and being brought forward at a time when the attention of all
London was engaged in discovering him, cannot fail of producing full
houses. Astley seems to have taken up the matter very seriously, as
the piece abounds with much satire against the Monster. The songs also
are well adapted: the chorus of one concluding as follows,</p>

<div class="center">

good acquisition to Astley, who is said to be the author."</p>

<p>One lady (Mrs. R. Walpole) was fortunate enough to escape being

</div>

<p>The Monster was even made a party to Anti-slavery agitation, for at
the Westminster Forum in Panton Street, Haymarket, "by desire of
several ladies," was debated the question: "Which is the greater
disgrace to humanity, the ruffian who drags the female African from
her family, her kindred, and her native country, or the Monster who
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page251" name="page251"></a>(p. 251)</span> has lately wounded, or terrified, many ladies in this
metropolis?" The result of this discussion is not handed down to
posterity.</p>

<p>Still the Monster kept steadily at his work, and almost every day
brought its tale of some woman being stabbed: and, one being injured
in St. Pancras Parish, a meeting of the inhabitants was called at the
Percy Coffee House, on May 7th, and an association was formed "to
nightly patrol the streets of the south division of Saint Pancras,
from half-an-hour before sunset, till eleven at night, for the public
safety, and especially to guard that sex which a Monster, or Monsters,
in opposition to the dictates of nature, and humanity, have dared to
assault, and wound, with wanton, and savage, cruelty."</p>

<p>The idea that these outrages were not done single-handed, was on the
increase, and the indefatigable Mr. Angerstein again issued a placard,
and "informs the public, that from information he has received of the
person who, since Friday last, has assaulted and wounded several
women, there is great reason to fear that more than one of these
wretches infests the streets: it is therefore thought necessary to
give the following description of one, who, within this week, has
committed many acts of cruelty upon women," and gives four
descriptions of the man's dress, which would lead to the inference
that the Monster was in possession of a very extensive wardrobe.</p>

<p>People were now gradually getting into a state of ferment, and the
Monster was the engrossing topic of public interest. Of course, then
as now, the wrong people were arrested occasionally. One "Walter Hill,
was brought before the Magistrate at Litchfield Street on suspicion of
being one of the wretches who have cut several women; he was
apprehended in Windmill Street, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page252" name="page252"></a>(p. 252)</span> Tottenham Court Road, near
the place where two women were cut, though Miss Porter, and several
other ladies, declared the prisoner was not the person who wounded
them." Nothing could be proved against him, and, ultimately, he was
discharged.</p>

<p>Even the light-fingered fraternity entered into the spirit of the
times, for <cite>The World</cite> of May 11th has&mdash;"Public Office, Bow St.,
before Sir Sampson Wright. Yesterday evening, about half after seven
o'clock, a gentleman of family and fortune, was surrounded in Holborn
by a number of pickpockets, who, after hustling him, and robbing him
of his watch, money, and hat, called out: 'That is the Monster, he has
just cut a woman.' A vast number of people immediately pursued the
gentleman, some calling 'The Monster!' others, 'Stop thief,' till at
length he was knocked down, and surrounded by near a thousand people,
by whom he was very ill-treated, and, probably, would not have escaped
with life, had he not been, by some gentleman, taken into Gray's Inn
Coffee House; from whence he was conveyed to the Brown Bear, in Bow
Street, in a hackney-coach; where the mob were so exasperated that
they broke the windows of the house, and, could they have got at him,
would, no doubt, have massacred him: by stratagem he was, at nine
o'clock, brought to this office. When the above facts appeared, Sir
Sampson Wright lamented that it was not in his power to punish the
perpetrators of this daring, and alarming, assault, but did all he
could, by giving that gentleman his protection until the mob
dispersed."</p>

<p>Accounts of mock assaults were written to the papers, one of them
extremely circumstantial, telling how a courageous lady drew a pistol
"from her pocket and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page253" name="page253"></a>(p. 253)</span> discharged it into the wretch's neck,
immediately under the ear, who instantly left her, uttering the most
dreadful imprecations." This, it is needless to say, was denied, and
exposed next morning.</p>

<p>Imposture, of course, took advantage of such a golden opportunity, and
we find that "the account which appeared in all the newspapers of Miss
B. of Marylebone Street, having been twice wounded by the Monster,
proves to be a fabrication, for the purpose of exciting compassion,
and money, and has, in some degree, answered the purpose. The above
discovery has been made, by an investigation of this business, by the
Select Vestry of Marylebone Parish. This is a new kind of Monster!"</p>

<p>The <cite>Oracle</cite> of May 17th tells the following little story:&mdash;"Tuesday,
about nine o'clock, as Mr. Heather was crossing Tower Hill, he
observed a well-dressed woman upon the ground: when he went to her,
she said a very tall man had just wounded her with some sharp
instrument, and begged his assistance to get to the Minories to a
coach, which he readily complied with, upon observing blood in several
places upon her gown and apron. However, the coach had not been gone
ten minutes, before he found she had picked his pocket of his watch,
and about three guineas."</p>

<p>Although there was now a cessation of real attacks by the Monster, the
public feeling rose to very fever height. As one newspaper remarked:
"The Monster is now a mischief of more than common magnitude. Inhuman
himself, the villainy is visited upon all who are of the same sex:
alike the source of apprehension, terror, and flight. It is really
distressing to walk our streets towards evening. Every woman we meet
regards us with distrust, shrinks sidling from our touch, and expects
a <span class="pagenum"><a id="page254" name="page254"></a>(p. 254)</span> poignard to pierce what gallantry, and manhood, consider as
sacred. There must be a very criminal supineness somewhere, or these
execrable villains would, with greater speed, expiate with their
lives, the insulted humanity of being."</p>

<p>As an example of the pitch to which the excitement was wrought, the
following case may be taken. A man met a girl, and went with her into
a public-house. They sat down, and he showed her an artificial
bouquet, or nosegay, as it was then called, which he had in his hand,
and begged her to accept it. The girl, in taking hold of it, felt
something prick her, and it made her hand bleed. She went away, and
told the story to some of her friends, who immediately insisted that
it must be the Monster, and that a dagger was certainly concealed in
the nosegay. The man was in consequence arrested, and kept all night
in the watch-house. On enquiry in the morning, it was found that the
girl's hand had only been pricked by the wire used to bind the flowers
together, and the poor man was, of course, discharged.</p>

<p>But Nemesis was at hand. One of his victims&mdash;that Miss Porter, who was
stabbed after the Drawing Room, on the Queen's birthday&mdash;was walking
with Mr. John Coleman, in St. James's Park, on Sunday, June 13th, and
the Monster passed her. She at once recognised him, and, her agitation
being remarked by Mr. Coleman, she said, "There is the wretch who
wounded me." Mr. Coleman left her in charge of her friends, and
followed the man, who walked very fast&mdash;evidently feeling he had been
noticed, and endeavoured to dodge about from Spring Gardens, to
Admiralty Passage, back again to Spring Gardens, and up Cockspur
Street, to Pall Mall: thence to St. James's Street, and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page255" name="page255"></a>(p. 255)</span>
Bolton Street, where he knocked at the door of a house, and was let
in. He stayed there about five minutes, and then went to Piccadilly,
and St. James's Street, where he knocked at another house, and asked
the servant some question. Leaving there, he went to Bond Street, Mr.
Coleman endeavouring to insult him, by walking before and behind him,
and staring him in the face. He then went to Oxford Street&mdash;then
called Oxford Road&mdash;and Vere Street, where he knocked at an empty
house. Then Mr. Coleman spoke to him, and asked him what was the use
of knocking so violently at a house palpably empty; and he replied
that he knew the people of the house, named Pearce, and knocked again
for three or four minutes. He then crossed to South Molton Street,
knocked at a house, and was admitted. Mr. Coleman asked the master of
the house, Mr. Smith, for information as to the man, but he refused to
give any, unless some reason was assigned. Mr. Coleman replied that
the other had insulted some ladies under his protection, and that he
demanded satisfaction. The Monster offered to meet him at any
coffee-house, and gave his address as Fifty-two Jermyn Street. Mr.
Coleman then let him go, but upon second thoughts hurried back, and
again met him in St. James's Street; and looking at him, told him he
did not think he was what he described himself, and asked him to come
with him to Mr. Porter's house, which was not far off. He consented,
and on seeing him, two of the Miss Porters immediately fainted, but
upon recovery unhesitatingly declared him to be "the wretch." He
turned to Mr. Coleman and asked: "Do the ladies suspect me to be the
person advertised? Am I suspected?"</p>

<p>He was given into custody, and on the 15th of June, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page256" name="page256"></a>(p. 256)</span> the
newspapers gave full accounts of his capture and examination.</p>

<p>He proved to be a native of Wales, named Renwick (or Rhynwick)
Williams, aged about twenty-three, who was sent young to London, where
he was bound apprentice to Sir John Gallini, with a view to his
becoming a dancer on the stage. A misunderstanding, as to the
disappearance of a watch, severed this connection, and he then led a
very loose life. For some little time, about two months, he was a
lawyer's clerk, but this employment being only temporary, he was
reduced to difficulties, until he met with Mr. Aimable Michell, of
Dover Street, who taught him artificial-flower making, and with whom
he remained until his arrest.</p>

<p>He was dressed very respectably, in a blue coat, lined, and edged,
with buff, buff waistcoat, and black satin breeches.</p>

<p>He was fully identified by the Misses Porter, Miss Frost, Miss
Baughan, and Mrs. Franklin, whilst numerous ladies who had been
wounded could not identify him. He was of course, remanded. Royalty,
in the person of the Duke of Cumberland (afterwards King of Hanover),
was present at his examination, and great difficulty was experienced
in preserving the prisoner from the fury of the exasperated mob.</p>

<p>On the 16th of June he was again brought up, was identified by two
more ladies, and confronted with others, who could not be sure he was
the man who had wounded them. The Dukes of York, and Cumberland, and
Prince William of Gloucester, besides several peers, were present.</p>

<p>He was brought before the magistrates once more, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page257" name="page257"></a>(p. 257)</span> when another
lady identified him, and he was committed for trial.</p>

<a id="img084" name="img084"></a>

<p class="caption">Renwick Williams.&mdash;1790.</p>
</div>

<p>Owing to the novelty of the crime, great difficulty was experienced as
to his indictment, but it was at last settled that he should be tried
under the statute 6th Geo. I. c. 23, s. 11, which made it felony,
punishable with transportation, for seven years, to assault any person
in the public streets, with intent to tear, spoil, cut, burn, or
deface, the garments, or clothes, of such person, or persons, provided
the act be done in pursuance of such intention.</p>

<p>On Thursday, the 8th of July, Williams was tried at the Old Bailey,
before Mr. Justice Buller, charged with making an assault upon Ann
Frost, spinster, on the 9th of November last, in Jermyn Street, St.
James's, and wickedly, wilfully, and maliciously, tearing, and
spoiling, her garments, to wit, the gown, petticoats, and shift, of
the said Ann, against the statute in that case provided.</p>

<p>He was also indicted for the commission of a similar offence in
Holborn, on the 5th of May, on Sarah, the wife of John Davis. The same
on Sarah, the wife of John Godfrey, on the 13th of May, in St.
Marylebone. The 26th of September, on Mary Forster, in Maxwell Street.
The 6th of December, on Elizabeth Baughan, in Parliament Street. For a
like act, on the same day, in the same street, on Frances Baughan. For
a like act, on Ann Porter, on the 18th of January, in St. James's
Street.</p>

<p>He pleaded not guilty, and was defended by counsel. The case of Miss
Porter was then gone into, and the evidence, as already detailed, was
adduced. For the defence, he called his master, Mr. Michell, who swore
that he was at work till twelve, on the night of the 18th <span class="pagenum"><a id="page258" name="page258"></a>(p. 258)</span> of
January, and did not quit his house till after supper at half-past
twelve, which was also substantiated by the witness of his sister,
Miss Michell, Catherine, and Molly Harmond, and two of the workwomen,
besides a customer: and ten witnesses were called as to character. The
judge summed up very favourably for the prisoner, but the jury,
without hesitation, found him guilty. The judge said, as this was a
new case, and he had some doubts as to the indictment, he would
respite judgment until he had laid the case before the twelve judges.
So this, and the other indictments, were put off until the December
Sessions.</p>

<p>There were many accounts of the trial, and numerous portraits were
published of Williams, who was by no means bad-looking, thin and pale,
with powdered hair "en queue."</p>

<p>The caricaturists took the matter up, and treated the matter as a
joke, recommending ladies to have copper petticoats, &amp;c.</p>

<p>But the most awful picture is that of "The Monster going to take his
afternoon luncheon," where he is depicted as a terrible being about to
devour a pretty girl&mdash;but the caricaturist shows us, kindly, "the
Monster disappointed of his afternoon luncheon," in which engraving,
he has a double shot&mdash;one at the somewhat delicate subject of the
"dress improver" of the day, and the other, how this fashion might be
utilised to baffle the Monster of his intended meal.</p>

<p>There was the usual newspaper correspondents' wrangle, in which, of
course, it was unpopular to advance any argument in favour of the
Monster. Indeed, <cite>The World</cite>, of October 16th, says: "Writing a
defence of the Monster carries with it more serious consequences
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page259" name="page259"></a>(p. 259)</span> than people are at first aware of, because it would appear as
if publishing accounts, in the newspapers, or otherwise, could really
justify atrocious acts. As Junius has said: 'The people at large are
never mistaken in their sentiments, and, if they have formed an
opinion, there is no taking them out of it by misrepresentation.'"
That there was an opinion in his favour is not only evidenced by this,
but at the City Debates, Capel Court, Bartholomew Lane, the question
was debated on July 12: "Did the late extraordinary conduct ascribed
to Renwick Williams (commonly called the Monster) originate in an
unfortunate insanity, a diabolical inclination to injure the fair part
of the creation, or the groundless apprehension of some mistaken
females?"</p>

<p class="caption">Protection from the MONSTER.</p>
</div>

<p>But the man kept up the feeling against him, by his own conduct, and
could not be quiet in prison. <cite>The Oracle</cite>, of August the 20th, has
the following account of "The Monster's Ball":&mdash;"The depravity of the
times was manifested last week, in an eminent degree, in Newgate. The
Monster sent cards of invitation to about twenty couple, among whom
were some of his alibi friends, his brother, sisters, several of the
prisoners, and others, whom we shall take a future opportunity to
notice.</p>

<p>"At four o'clock the party sat to tea; this being over, two violins
struck up, accompanied by a flute, and the company proceeded to
exercise their limbs. In the merry dance, the cuts, and entrechats, of
the Monster were much admired, and his adroitness in that amusement
must be interesting, from the school in which he acquired this branch
of his accomplishments.</p>

<p>"About eight o'clock the company partook of a cold supper, and a
variety of wines, such as would not discredit <span class="pagenum"><a id="page260" name="page260"></a>(p. 260)</span> the most
sumptuous gala, and about nine o'clock departed, that being the usual
hour for locking the doors of the prison."</p>

<p>Williams gradually faded away from public notice until early in
November, when eleven of the judges met in Serjeants' Inn Hall, and
consulted on his case, which had been reserved. The questions were:
First, whether his having an intention to cut the person of Miss
Porter, and, in carrying that intention into execution, cutting the
garments of that lady, is an offence within the statute of 6th Geo. I.
c. 23, s. 11, on which he was convicted; the jury having, in their
verdict, found that in cutting her person he had thereby an intention
to cut her garments? Secondly, whether the statute being in the
conjunctive, "that if any person shall assault with an intent to cut
the garment of such person, then the offender shall be guilty of
felony," and the indictment, in stating the intention, not having
connected it with the act by inserting the words that he "then and
there" did cut her garment, could be supported in point of form?</p>

<p>Nine out of the eleven judges were of opinion that the offence,
notwithstanding the finding of the jury, was not within the statute,
and that the indictment was bad in point of law.</p>

<p>This decision reduced the Monster's crime to a misdemeanour.</p>

<p>On Monday, December 13th, he was brought to trial at the Sessions
House, Clerkenwell Green, and, as a proof of the interest it created,
even the names of the jury are recorded. The trial began at ten, <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>,
and was inaugurated by the prisoner reading a paper declaring his
innocence. He was indicted for assaulting Miss Porter, with intent to
kill, and murder her: there was a <span class="pagenum"><a id="page261" name="page261"></a>(p. 261)</span> second count which stated,
that he, "holding a knife in his right hand, did wilfully give the
said Ann Porter a dreadful wound, of great length and depth on the
right thigh and hip; to wit, of the length of nine inches, and the
depth of four." A third count charged him with a common assault. The
evidence was similar to that in the former trial, and, after a trial,
lasting thirteen hours, he was found guilty.</p>

<p>He was afterwards found guilty of other assaults, and was finally
sentenced to two years' imprisonment in Newgate, for each assault on
Miss Porter, Elizabeth Davis, and Miss E. Baughan, and at the end of
the six years, he was to find bail for good behaviour for seven years,
himself in the sum of two hundred pounds, and two sureties in one
hundred pounds each.</p>

<p>What finally became of him is not known. Mr. Angerstein offered the
reward to Miss Porter, as it was by her instrumentality that the
Monster was captured, but she refused it.</p>

<p>The recollection of <em>the Monster</em>, did not quickly fade away, for we
read in the <cite>Times</cite>, 20 Dec. 1799, "Another new <em>Monster</em> on
Wednesday, made his appearance in town. His passion is for <em>biting</em>
the Ladies' <em>toes</em> and <em>finger ends</em>. They say his name is <i>Frost</i>."</p>

<p class="p2">Food riots, the natural outcome of an almost starving and ignorant
population were rife; but, in the following paragraph, there is a
curious allusion, that <em>the grain was intended to be shipped to
France</em>, with which nation we were then at war.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"Several towns in Cornwall were last week visited by large bodies
     of Miners, from the different works, in search of concealed corn,
     which they insist upon is intended for exportation <span class="pagenum"><a id="page262" name="page262"></a>(p. 262)</span> to
     France. At Wadebridge, they found about 25,000 bushels in store,
     which they obliged the Owners to sell at reduced prices. At Looe
     upwards of 6000 bushels of grain were stopped by them from being
     shipped, but we do not hear of their committing any other
     outrage. Part of the first regiment of dragoons is gone from
     Devonshire, to assist the magistrates in restoring
     peace."&mdash;(<cite>Times, Feb. 6, 1793.</cite>)</p>
</div>

<p>Highway robberies were of daily occurrence, so much so, that they are
not worth chronicling, unless some special circumstance occurs in
connection with them.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"The pickpockets are all turned highwaymen. Thus far the
     metropolis has been delivered from these free-booters: and the

     <p class="p2">"At Oxford, a person was convicted of having robbed the Worcester
     and Oxford Coach, near Woodstock, of a portmanteau, and this
     peculiar circumstance attended it:&mdash;The man committed the

     <em>twelve</em> hours after the commission of the crime. He was indicted
     for petty larceny only."&mdash;(<cite>Times, March 28, 1793.</cite>)</p>

     <p class="p2">"Mr. <span class="smcap">Burdon</span>, the Member for the County of Durham, had 25,000

     carrying down this sum, for the relief of the Durham
     Bank."&mdash;(<cite>Times, April 26, 1793.</cite>)</p>
</div>

<p>A shocking trade had sprung up, which was not long in developing. As
Science grew, so was a knowledge of Anatomy becoming of more vital
importance to the medical profession&mdash;but subjects for operation were
scarce. True, those malefactors who were hanged, and had no friends,
were given over to the Surgeons for dissection, but this means of
supply, fell far short of the demand&mdash;which, however, was met, by the
ghastly <span class="pagenum"><a id="page263" name="page263"></a>(p. 263)</span> device of robbing the grave-yards of their newly
buried dead. Here are some contemporary records of the doings of these
ghouls:&mdash;</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"Friday, a gang of persons, called <em>Resurrection men</em>, were
     apprehended between two, and three, o'clock in the morning, near
     the Churchyard at Hampstead; they had dug up the body of a Mr.
     John Lloyd, who had been buried the day before, put it into a
     sack, and a hackney-coach was waiting to receive it; but, by the
     vigilance, and resolution, of the watchmen, they lost their prey;
     for, having stopt the coach, they found the body in it, and two
     men, whose names are Tom Paine, and Peter Mackintosh, together
     with their shovels, and tools, for opening the coffin. They were
     both carried before Master Montague, together with John Peach,
     the driver of the Coach, and were committed to gaol upon the
     fullest evidence. There were two others of the party, who made
     their escape. One of them had the appearance of a Gentleman, and
     is supposed to be a surgeon."&mdash;(<cite>Times, March 15, 1794.</cite>)</p>

     <p class="p2">"On Monday evening, a set of Resurrectionists, were apprehended
     at a house near the Turnpike, Mile end. That morning, a coach was
     observed to stop at this house, and an ill looking man came out
     of it with a sack; containing as it was supposed, a body, which
     he carried into the house, and returned immediately with a large
     hamper:&mdash;they then drove off to a neighbouring public-house,
     when, after a short stay, they took up some others, and were
     traced to the Launch, at Deptford. In the meantime, the parish
     officers were informed of the circumstance. About six in the
     evening, the coach again returned with a similar lading, which
     was deposited in the house. Some constables, accompanied by a
     number of people, surrounded the house, and forcing an entrance,
     they found two men, and a woman, drinking tea on a bench, at one
     end of which lay the bodies of two children. They were secured:
     and, on entering an adjoining room, the bodies of six adults were
     discovered, unmutilated; besides which, the floor was strewed
     with limbs, in a state too shocking for public
     description."&mdash;(<cite>Times, March 20, 1794.</cite>)</p>

     <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page264" name="page264"></a>(p. 264)</span> "A very particular account has been sent to this Paper,
     of the late shocking discovery of dead bodies at Mile-End: but we
     deem it unfit for publication, as the circumstances are too
     horrid to meet the public eye. Every room in the house was a
     scene of the most shocking brutality, and it is supposed there
     were upwards of 100 bodies, some whole, others mangled. The
     remains found at this house have since been removed to Bethnal
     Green church-yard, for a second interment. We most sincerely hope

     <p>"Some persons having been discovered, on the evening of the 8th
     February last, conveying dead Bodies in Sacks, from the
     Burial-Ground belonging to the Parish of St. Mary, Lambeth, and

     One hundred Pounds, for apprehending them, was immediately
     offered by the Churchwardens, to be paid upon their conviction:

     Parishioners in Vestry, in order to consider by what means they
     might secure the offenders, bring them to punishment, and
     prevent, in future, such depredations. A Committee was
     accordingly appointed for this purpose, and discoveries of
     similar robberies in Church-yards, and Burial-grounds, in, and
     near, this Metropolis, have been made, the recital of which,
     together with an account of the horrid traffic in which many have
     been long engaged, with impunity, cannot fail to excite the

     time, to give them, taken from Affidavits made before
     Magistrates, and from other evidence procured on this melancholy
     occasion. It will be needless to say, that the Relatives, and
     Friends, of those who have been lately buried there, before this
     discovery, have suffered great anguish of mind, and it is not
     doubted but that all will concur in adopting measures, which may
     effectually check such abominable practices. For this desirable
     end, an application to Parliament, early in the next Session, is
     deemed highly necessary, as, at present, the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page265" name="page265"></a>(p. 265)</span> punishment
     is found to be by no means sufficient to prevent the crime. The
     Parishes therefore, within the Bills of Mortality, and near
     London, will, it is hoped, approve of such application, and it is
     intended that a Circular Letter shall be sent to them, to invite
     them to join in it. In the meantime, the Committee of the Parish
     of Saint Mary, Lambeth, will be glad to receive any
     communications from any other Parishes, on this subject, under

     <p class="p2">"Early on Tuesday Morning, some suspicion being entertained that
     the Pesthouse burial-ground, in Old-Street-Road, had been
     frequently violated, the parish watchmen were ordered to keep a
     good look out, when a hackney coach was observed, waiting near
     the spot. Upon the watchman's approaching it, he was assaulted,
     and beaten, by three men, who then made off: but afterwards,
     springing his rattle, the assistants took the coachman into
     custody, who had three sacks in his coach, two of them containing
     the body of a man each, and the other, three children. Several
     other bodies, which had been dug up for the purpose of carrying
     away, were found under the wall of the burying-ground: and, it is
     generally believed, that almost all the bodies deposited therein,
     for 5 weeks past, have been stolen, which, upon an average, must
     have been 15 per week. The hackney-coachman, who owned he was to
     have had ten guineas for his night's fare, was committed to the
     New Prison, Clerkenwell. This fellow, it should seem, was
     hardened to his business: for, though put into the cage with the
     bodies he was carrying off, he slept so sound, that it was with
     some difficulty he was awakened by the visit of a <em>brother-whip</em>,
     previous to his going before a Magistrate."&mdash;(<cite>Times, Dec, 23,

     information that a person of the name of <i>Pullen</i>, a notorious
     offender who was sentenced to a year's imprisonment for dealing
     in base money, had been carrying on his former trade, while in
     confinement: that the base money of the similitude of a shilling,
     being previously prepared of blanched copper, with <span class="smcap">King William's</span>
     head faintly impressed on one side, and plain on the other, was
     brought into the prison privately by Agents whom he employed:
     that after the Cells were locked up, this adroit Coiner prepared
     a liquid in which very thin pieces of silver were mixed, which,
     being rubbed upon the Copper shillings, instantly give them the
     appearance of worn down coin of the Mint: that he was assisted in
     the operation by several of the prisoners in the same ward,
     <span class="pagenum"><a id="page273" name="page273"></a>(p. 273)</span> some of whom were his associates in iniquity, and
     convicted of offences against the Mint Laws: That his customers
     came regularly to the prison, and purchased the base money so
     finished at <em>two</em> for <em>one</em>, paying sixpence for each shilling,
     although intrinsically not worth a halfpenny: that the dies, and
     some other implements for coining belonging to these delinquents,
     had been actually lodged in their trunks at Newgate, and they
     were brought there privately, on every alarm of danger from
     officers of justice, as a place of greater security. This
     information having been communicated to Sir <span class="smcap">William Staines</span>, one
     of the present Sheriffs of London and Middlesex, with the zeal
     for the public good which characterises the active Magistrate, he
     went alone to Newgate, early in the morning, before the cells
     were unlocked, and caused the trunks, and boxes, belonging to the
     persons convicted of offences against the Mint Laws, to be
     searched; and, in a trunk concealed under <i>Pullen's</i> bed, were
     found no less than £107, 2s. of base money, of the similitude of
     shillings, ready for circulation, and a machine for rounding, or
     milling, the edges of half crowns; and in another trunk belonging
     to an associate of <i>Pullen</i>, were found two plain dies, and two
     others for halfpence, and farthings. It would appear that some
     other dies for halfcrowns, and shillings, which had been
     deposited for some time in a trunk belonging to <i>Pullen</i>, were
     removed, together with the book he kept for entering the names of
     his customers who visited him, for the purpose of purchasing base
     money for the town, and country, circulation.... The <span class="smcap">Lord Mayor</span>

     The result is, that the <span class="smcap">Lord Mayor</span> and <span class="smcap">Sheriffs</span> are taking

<p>Duels were of as common occurrence, as highway robberies, and need as
much comment. Still, I give two, or three, instances to show on what
trifles, men, then, ventured their lives.</p>

<p>The first is an ordinary duel between two officers, reported in the
<cite>Morning Post</cite> of 22nd June 1788&mdash;in which one of them was wounded in
the thigh. This report brings a letter from some one, probably a
second, who gives his version thus:&mdash;"Sir, in your account of the duel
between Captains Tonge and Paterson, in your Paper of the 22nd, there
is a mistake or two, which, for the sake of truth, I beg leave to
correct. You say, 'that <em>Capt. T. wished to apologise for the injury
he had done</em>.' The truth is, Captain T. being not quite himself when
the affray happened, remembered very little of what had passed, except
that, on some provocation, he had struck Capt. P. Considering himself,
therefore, as having, <em>palpably</em> broken the peace, he was ready to ask
Capt. P.'s pardon.</p>

<p>"This was not deemed sufficient satisfaction, and the duel took place.
You tell us, that <cite>Capt. T.'s ball passed Capt. P.</cite>, thereby implying
that Capt. T. actually fired at his antagonist. Now, Sir, I can
positively affirm that Capt. T. was determined not to fire his pistol,
and that it was involuntarily discharged, after he was wounded, and
not levelled at Capt. P. You tell us then, that Capt. T., upon
falling, declared that '<cite>he had merited his fate, and begged Capt.
P.'s pardon</cite>.' His words were, <cite>Are you <span class="pagenum"><a id="page276" name="page276"></a>(p. 276)</span> satisfied? I fear I
am dangerously wounded, I therefore advise you to fly.</cite></p>

<p>"To enable the Public to judge properly of this affair, it is
necessary they should be told, that the first offence was, Capt. T.'s
treading accidentally on Capt. P.'s heel, who, though he saw Capt. T.
was intoxicated, continued to follow him.</p>

<h3>FRENCH EMIGRANTS.</h3>

<p>We have seen how, at the outbreak of the French Revolution, the French
came over here in thousands&mdash;escaping here as to a haven of refuge.
For the most part they were of the better class; still there were, as
in 1870, a large number of very suspicious characters (to use the
mildest term) among them&mdash;and the government was compelled to keep a
very jealous eye on their movements. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page277" name="page277"></a>(p. 277)</span> Taken, however, as a
whole, they behaved wonderfully well, and in no ways abused the
asylum, and protection, they had sought.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"Government is ridding the country very fast of <span class="smcap">Jacobins</span>: and in
     doing so, it is taking only a proper precaution during a time of
     war. Some hundreds have been already either expelled, or have
     quitted the country through apprehension; but many more still
     remain here: and we recommend very strongly to the notice of the
     Police Department, the general body of <em>French Dancing Masters</em>
     practising in London, who are the veriest Jacobins in existence.

     <p>"Some of the papers have circulated very idle reports relative to
     the arrival, in London, of 140 French soldiers; the story
     <span class="pagenum"><a id="page278" name="page278"></a>(p. 278)</span> is precisely as follows: These unfortunate Emigrants,
     most of them descended from opulent, and illustrious, families in
     France, having saved themselves, with the French Princes, from
     the daggers of assassins, were necessitated, at the end of the
     campaign, to enter the service of Spain. They embarked, on the
     4th Dec., at <i>Bois le Duc</i>, for <i>Rotterdam</i>, and from thence,
     they sailed in the ship <i>David and Abraham</i>, commanded by Captain
     <i>Riendirk</i>. It would be impossible to describe the bad usage they
     received on board. Obliged to lay upon the bare deck, without a
     bed, and fed with mouldy biscuit, and beer, mixed with salt
     water; in this lamentable situation they remained five weeks.
     These miserable men were covered with vermin, most of them,
     dreadfully galled with sores, and ulcers. Some had not changed
     their linen for two years and an half: others had no linen of any
     kind, and the clothes of the whole troop were in tatters. There
     is reason to believe that the Captain of the vessel proposed to
     sell them as malefactors, to be sent to Batavia. The ship,
     however, was driven on our coast, and as soon as our Government
     was apprized that these poor men were at anchor in Sheerness,
     they took every measure to soften the rigour of their fate. Two
     of their countrymen were dispatched to bring them to London. The
     barbarous inhumanity of the Dutch Captain was notoriously
     conspicuous, and we hope some measures will be taken to bring him
     to justice, and make him an example to others, to avoid similar
     acts of inhumanity."&mdash;(<cite>Times, Feb. 28, 1793.</cite>)</p>

     by their distresses."&mdash;(<cite>Times, Dec. 27, 1797.</cite>)</p>

     <p class="p2">"A French Emigrant was, yesterday, examined before Mr. Ford, at
     the Duke of Portland's Office, on a charge of being a Spy. The
     circumstances adduced were on the information of a Journeyman

     boots with a Cavity between the Soles; covered with sheet lead to
     prevent the wet perforating, for letters of a secret nature.

     employed by the Duke d'Harcourt, on a mission to the officers of

     improper, he was discharged: but, the maker of the boots having
     been, for some time, considered a disaffected person, is to be

     any foreigner who resides in the parish. This measure, we
     conceive, would become still more efficacious, if every landlord,

<p>This was the last of these mock elections&mdash;and we may well pause for a
while, and examine this curious institution&mdash;unique in its way&mdash;not
thoroughly well-known&mdash;and whose origin, even, is in dispute.</p>

<p>Not far from Wandsworth, on the road to Tooting, is found the hamlet
of Garrett, or Garrat, which, in the time of Queen Elizabeth, appears
to have consisted of a single house, called "the Garvett." This was,
at the time of its destruction, about the year 1760, in the possession
of the Broderick family, and its grounds were then let to a market
gardener. Lyson's, writing in 1792, says the hamlet consisted of about
50 houses&mdash;but it grew until it became incorporated into Wandsworth,
and its site is still known by "Garret Lane," "Garret Green," "Garret
Hill," &amp;c.</p>

<p>As regards the curious mock election which took place here with each
new Parliament, nothing certain is known, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page291" name="page291"></a>(p. 291)</span> and opinions are
divided, as to its origin. Dr. Ducarel, an antiquary, writing in 1754,
tells us, that as far as he can find out, it began, some 60 or 70
years previously, with some Wandsworth Watermen, who went to a public
house, called the Leather Bottle, at Garrat, to spend a merry
day&mdash;and, it being a general election, they, in fun, chose one of
their number as Member for Garrat.</p>

<p class="caption">Jeffrey Dunstan,&mdash;Ordinary Costume.</p>
</div>

<p>Another version is given in the "Gentleman's Magazine" for 1781, in
which a writer says he was told, that about thirty years previously,
several persons who lived near that part of Wandsworth which adjoins
to Garrat Lane, had formed a kind of Club, not merely for the
pleasures of the table, but to concert measures for removing the
encroachments made on that part of the Common; and to prevent any
others being made, for the future. When a sufficient sum of money had
been subscribed amongst them, they brought an action against the
encroacher, in the name of the president (or, as they called him,
Mayor,) of the Club. They gained their suit, with costs, and, ever
after, the president, was called "the Mayor of Garrat." This event
happening at the time of a general election, the ceremony, which took
place every new parliament, of choosing <em>outdoor</em> members for the
borough of Garrat, was continued.</p>

<p>The earliest record of Members being chosen, is in 1747, when three
Candidates for the honour appeared. Lord Twankum Squire Blow me down
(Willis, a Waterman) and Squire Gubbins, (one Simmonds, a publican.)
The "Clerk," and "Recorder," issued from an imaginary Town Hall. There
were proper Hustings, at which an oath was administered to the
electors which, according to Grose, was sworn on a brick bat&mdash;and the
qualification <span class="pagenum"><a id="page292" name="page292"></a>(p. 292)</span> was, that the juror had had an amour in the
surrounding open fields.</p>

<p>There was a great deal of rough wit in the candidate's speeches, and
Foote, Garrick, and Wilkes, were credited with writing their
addresses. Foote even wrote a play, called "the Mayor of Garratt,"
which was produced at Drury Lane. There were elections in 1761, 1763,
1768, &amp;c. That of 1781&mdash;was famous for the magnificence of its
procession&mdash;having a real live man in armour. In 1784, Sir Jeffrey
Dunstan (they all dubbed themselves knights) was elected to the
honourable post, and he held it till his death in 1796.</p>

<p>This worthy needs a passing notice. His birth, and education, were but
humble, for he was found, wrapped in a cloth, on the door step of a
Church warden, of St. Dunstan's in the East&mdash;hence his name of
Dunstan. He grew up deformed, and rickety, and, at the age of 12, was
apprenticed to a greengrocer, for 9 years&mdash;but the servitude galled
him, and he ran away, finding employment at Birmingham. He returned to
London in 1776 and soon afterwards married&mdash;and had two daughters, who
were really fine young women. He was squalid, and filthy, in his
dress, and got his living by buying, and selling, old wigs. His
humour, however, gained him his election for Garrett. The accompanying
illustrations shew him in his ordinary dress, as "Old Wigs," and in
the superb court suit which he sported at election times.</p>

<p>The Election, at last, led to such disgraceful scenes, that even the
publicans, who were its chief mainstay, would no longer support it:
and Sir Harry Dimsdale, holds the proud pre-eminence of being the last
elected Member.</p>

     <p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;Among many others, I was yesterday a spectator of what you
     notice in your paper of this morning. A pair of those noble
     animals, which, for several years, have drawn his Majesty's State
     Coach, degraded to a hack. The spectacle <span class="pagenum"><a id="page296" name="page296"></a>(p. 296)</span> really gave me
     concern, and must certainly reflect disgrace somewhere. It
     necessarily suggests two considerations, one relative to the
     dignity of Majesty itself, the other to the natural emotions of
     sensibility. What! say the vulgar, are the <i>King's</i> State Horses
     come to this? Oh! what a pity! says the man of sensibility, that
     these poor creatures recently, and habitually, so caressed, and
     pampered, should experience such a lamentable reverse! How
     fallen, how abused, how galled! I assure you, Mr. Editor, they
     are <em>literally</em>, and <em>grievously</em>, <em>galled</em>. Surely his Majesty
     must be a stranger to all this: and it would be of no dis-service
     to him, to let the Public know that he is so. Those who love him,
     cannot but feel for his horses, nor refrain from thinking that
     his sensibility, as a man, must be hurt, at hearing of the
     sufferings of those stately animals, which once contributed to
     his most magnificent public appearance.</p>

     often be prevented in families. Experience has likewise proved

     <p>"It was not a <span class="smcap">Tom Cat</span>, for its melodious squalls plainly proved
     it had long been qualified for the Opera.&mdash;It was, however, a
     prodigious favourite with its Mistress. Long had it lived upon
     the fat of the land, in Charlotte St., Queen Anne St., where it
     took great care of Number <span class="smcap">One</span>! For the space of six years and
     three months did its Mistress indulge it with '<span class="smcap">Rivers</span> of Milk;'
     and besides it was a sad Cat, for the matter of that, in skimming
     the cream off everything worth skimming. But as Cats, though they
     may have nine lives, are not immortal, poor <span class="smcap">Ralph</span> fell sick and
     died&mdash;without giving time even for a consultation of Physicians!
     His Mistress, after the first transports of grief were subsided,
     sent for a Surgeon, who opened the body. He reported that poison
     was not the cause, as suspected, of his death, but that he was
     <span class="pagenum"><a id="page307" name="page307"></a>(p. 307)</span> literally killed with kindness. In plain English, he
     died of a Plethora, for he was fat at heart.</p>

     <p>"Away posted the Lady and purchased a piece of ground, just large
     enough to swing a Cat in, at the new burial ground in
     Mary-le-bonne. The charge was trifling, only two guineas; an
     Undertaker provided a coffin in miniature: <i>Grimalkin</i>, after
     having lain in state, and several of the frail sisterhood,
     friends of the Lady, partaken of wine and cake, of which plenty
     was provided; a Hearse with <span class="smcap">White</span> Plumes drove to the door, and
     the Lady, a Chief Mourner, attended by her weeping friends, who
     filled several Mourning Coaches, followed <span class="smcap">Ralph</span> to the grave last
     Tuesday week, like 'Niobe all in tears;' and after the body had
     been deposited in the earth, though with but 'maimed rites,' 'tis
     true, she returned slowly to the house of mourning.</p>

     <p>"But now comes the sad <span class="smcap">Cat</span>-astrophe&mdash;Whether the Undertaker who
     had <em>undertaken</em> to keep the secret, had blabbed, or whether the
     spectators of this sad ceremony smelt, as the Cat had often done,
     a <span class="smcap">RAT</span>, so it was, however, that the body had not remained an
     hour, quietly inurned, ere they burst open the hinges of its
     sepulchre, and parading with it to the place from whence it came,
     proceeded to break the windows of the afflicted fair one's
     house: and but for the timely interposition of the Magistrates,
     the Lady, as well as her house, in all probability would have
     been pulled to pieces!!!</p>

     company frequent it, we again recommend that an additional door
     should be made, and an inscription put over it 'The company to go
     in at this gate, and return at the other,' by which means the
     press will be avoided, and directions given, that all servants do
     keep away from the doors, who behave with great impertinence to
     their superiors as the company go in. If the gardens are to be a

     This convenience was yesterday much noticed, as there is now one
     gate for the entrance, and another for leaving the gardens, which
     were extremely crowded. But so little regularity was observed in
     the procession of carriages, on the Park Road, that there was a
     general stoppage about four o'clock, for nearly an hour; in the

     Milford near Bury St. Edmund's: Three young Ladies of that place,
     one of whom is very much celebrated for her mental, as well as
     personal, accomplishments, agreed a few days since, to bathe in a
     river about half a mile distant from the town, there being no
     private accommodation for that purpose in the neighbourhood.</p>

     <p>"An early hour, at which they would be the least liable to be
     discovered by strangers, was determined on, and at four o'clock
     in the morning, they proceeded from home to the appointed place.
     As they walked through the town, they were espied by a
     blacksmith, who, about the same hour, usually gets up to his
     work. Curiosity prompted him to find out whither the fair ones
     were bound: but he did not discover himself to them till they
     were in the river, the perfect images of their mother <i>Eve</i>; when
     perceiving him approach, they screamed out, and prudently sat
     down in the water. The Modern <i>Vulcan</i>, dead to the distresses of
     the Venus's, determined to divert his uncouth fancy by carrying
     off their clothes, with which he did not return. In this pitiable
     situation they were obliged to remain for near an hour, when a
     poor woman passing that way, on hearing the rude behaviour they
     had experienced, and their consequent embarrassment, procured
     them such necessary articles of apparel, as enabled them to get
     home.</p>

     <p>"The blacksmith has since made a public boast of his exploit,
     saying it was a fine piece of sport: and, owing to his unfeeling
     and brutish conduct, the young Ladies have ever since been
     ashamed to be seen, even by their relations."&mdash;(<cite>Times, Aug. 8,

     the yellow-hammers from the Capital are so numerous, and frisky,
     that the humming birds, the cockatoos, and the birds of Paradise
     of the higher order won't always hop with them. Got back to
     Margate on my pony, for which I was to pay 18d. a side, and
     thought as I rode along on the sands, where I should dine. The
     boarding houses were all open to me, on paying for a week, or one
     guinea. This was a great temptation: but having been offered a
     party at the Bowling green, on Prospect Place, I conceived this
     to be a better thing, on account of the humours of the loaded
     pigeon, and the fun of the canting machine, and the fireworks at
     night. I accordingly rode to my lodgings to dress, and went
     immediately to dinner. After dinner proceeded to the libraries,
     where the raffling lists were filling fast: was induced to throw
     in my shillings at <span class="smcap">Silver's</span> and <span class="smcap">Were's</span>: from thence passed on to
     <span class="smcap">Wood's</span>, <span class="smcap">Surflen's</span>, and <span class="smcap">Garner's</span>. At Surflen's heard music, and
     several favourite glees: from thence to the playhouse, where I
     was invited to the rehearsal of a new piece, which was to be full
     of good things, if it had been suffered to be represented. It was
     now time to go to supper: I accordingly returned to the Coffee
     House, and from thence to the Billiard Room, where there was a
     violent cry of swindler, black-legs, and pickpocket, at which
     Mrs. Benson interfered, whilst her husband walked coolly up and
     down the Piazza, not venturing to intrude. The obnoxious person
     being turned out, and order restored, I retired at one o'clock in
     the morning.</p>

     <p>"Our early season has already begun, and those who are fond of
     cheap lodgings, have made their appearance <i lang="la">hirundine primâ</i>. I
     assure you, we have City Misses here at this moment, each of
     whom, in the vain idea of rising 'A new born Goddess from the
     Sea' sowces into salt water every morning. Our company is of the
     <em>greater</em> sort. We have Mrs. Deputy <i>Plumb</i>, with her naked
     daughters, who have scarce more cloathing than a <em>fig</em> leaf on
     them, and imitate their great grand-dame Eve in much more even
     than that. Then we have Mrs. <i>Pop</i> from Whitechapel. She came
     down in state in her own job-coach, which was loaded so full with
     <em>unredeemed</em> Articles for family wear, that her dear <em>pledges</em> of
     domestic Love, her daughters, who are the very <em>duplicate</em> of
     herself, in delicacy and beauty, were forced to come in the Hoy.
     But she vows it is so shocking to her feelings, that they never
     shall ride down <em>no more</em> in that nasty sort of water conveyance,
     though she should spend upon their luxury and elegance <em>ten</em>,
     out of that <em>thirty per cent.</em>, which she grinds from the
     necessitous miseries of hard-earned industry. Then we have three
     learned Ladies, who, after the great fatigues of novel-writing in
     the winter, have retired hither to display themselves to the vast
     pleasure, and edification, of some ancient enamoratus, who would
     not yield to Old Q himself in pretensions to gallantry. In truth,
     we begin to look gaily, early as it is: and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page326" name="page326"></a>(p. 326)</span> I would that
     the salt-water, for the benefit of the <i>Pops</i>, and the <i>Plumbs</i>,
     who frequent our watering places, could as easily wash away the
     mud of vulgarity, and affectation, from their hearts, as it does

     The Duke and Duchess of <span class="smcap">Marlborough</span> pass their time in a very
     retired manner indeed. His Grace walked for some time yesterday
     evening upon the <i>Steyne</i>; the company consisted chiefly of
     opulent Jews, needy fortune hunters, broken-down Cyprians,
     fishermen's daughters, and several fat city-dowdies, from the
     environs of Norton Folgate. Her Grace commands the Play on Friday
     evening, which will be her <em>first appearance</em> in public here for
     this season. The Officers of the Blues are the <em>great dashers</em> of
     the place: they associate with no one but their own Corps. The
     most of them keep their blood-horses, their curricles, and their
     girls. At one o'clock they appear on the parade, to hear the word
     of command given to the Subaltern Guard: afterwards they toss off
     their <em>goes</em> of brandy, dine about five, and come about eight to

     a wooden leg. Not fewer than 5000 people were assembled on the
     occasion, who were highly entertained with the exertions of the
     old veterans of the ocean, who never acted against their most
     inveterate enemy with more energy, each party striving to quit
     the field victorious. The evening coming on, the contest could
     not be decided, but it was so much in favour of the Timber toes,

     and the men, with one leg, beat the one arms, by 103 runnings.
     After the match was finished, the eleven one-legged <span class="pagenum"><a id="page327" name="page327"></a>(p. 327)</span> men

     <p class="p2">"This day, the Publicans in the Metropolis, and its vicinity,
     have, conformable to an agreement amongst themselves, withdrawn
     from the Public the accommodation of finding them Pewter Pots,
     agreeable to a long established custom, which will, of course,
     occasion great inconvenience to workmen of every description, who
     are employed in raising buildings, repairing houses, &amp;c.; as well
     as lodgers, and, even, to many respectable families. The profits
     upon Porter, for a length of time, have been very considerable,
     which proves itself beyond a doubt, by their acknowledging, in a
     Bill left at the houses of their customers, that they,
     collectively, sustain a loss, annually, of; £100,000 per annum,
     in Pots, which, by no means, could have been afforded, were not
     their returns somewhat enormous. Under that idea, it is presumed,
     having availed themselves of an opportunity, no longer to be
     liable to losses of that kind, in future, they will, as a
     recompence to the Public, make a reduction in price of the
     necessary article of Porter."&mdash;(<cite>Times, Sept. 2, 1796.</cite>)</p>

     <p class="p2">"The late determination of several of the Publicans, to alter the
     established mode of serving their outdoor customers, with quart,
     and pint pots, seems to have been copied from an old resolution
     of a certain Borough, which ran thus: 'Resolved, that the best
     means of preserving our lamps from being broken, is to take them
     down by night, and put them up in the day.' Such of the Publicans
     as have come into this new regulation, seem to estimate the loss
     of a few pots, beyond that of the most respectable of their
     customers. It is, however, very probable, that the Small-Beer
     Brewers will <span class="pagenum"><a id="page328" name="page328"></a>(p. 328)</span> profit by this circumstance, as table-beer
     may be ordered in by those who cannot be served any longer in the

<p>Bartholomew fair was first held <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1133, and it was then the

of a street, contiguous to Smithfield, where the fair was held, and
which has come down to us,&mdash;"Cloth fair," proves it, were there any
need. Of late years it got a nuisance, and public opinion demanded its
dissolution. The shows were discontinued in 1850, and the fair was
proclaimed, for the last time, in 1855. We see by the following
paragraph, from the <cite>Times</cite>, what was thought of it by decent-minded
people, as far back as 1796.</p>

     but they are now made subservient to corrupt the public mind by
     the most abandoned, and dissolute, manners. The motley multitude

     from time to time on Wormholt Scrubs by bull-baiting, to the
     great annoyance of the neighbourhood, and the disturbance of the

     window at some Dutch-pins in the skittle ground. One of these
     pins was mortally wounded in the belly by Ensign <em>Tight
     Breeches</em>, a man milliner's foreman, who drove a ball into it, at
     the amazing distance of two yards, without letting the gun fall
     out of his hand.</p>

     <p>"Six journeymen weavers, from Spital-fields, who went in a chaise
     cart, to Ealing, with two guns, were rather more fortunate, in
     respect to Game. They killed a lame hen at Acton, shot one goose
     on the Common, wounded a large sow, and filled their pockets and
     Game-bags with turnips, and cabbages. They imagined they sprung a
     pheasant near Gunnersbury House,&mdash;but it proved to be an old
     turkey-cock. At Eleven, they returned, very wet, and very drunk,
     having lost one of their guns, and broke the stock of the other,
     by flinging it at a tame rabbit, in a farmer's yard.</p>

     <p>"Four <em>gentlemen</em> from Leadenhall-Market, who went on the
     long-coach to Woolwich, as there are partridges in that part of
     Kent, killed two crows in Hanging-Wood Lane, blinded a jackass
     near the Warren, and wounded a sparrow, several feathers being
     perceived to drop from its wings. They had <span class="pagenum"><a id="page334" name="page334"></a>(p. 334)</span> tolerable
     good sport with a bat, their terriers being of an excellent
     breed, and having worried a flock of ducks in a ditch, and killed
     one, they returned from <em>Partridge shooting</em> about nine at night,
     very much fatigued indeed.</p>

     <p>"Five gentlemen who went sporting from Kent Bar to Lewisham,
     notwithstanding the wetness of the day, had tolerable good luck.</p>

     <p>"They belonged to the Trained Bands, and depended more upon their
     bayonets, than their guns. At the Half-Way-House they killed a
     fine buck-cat, as he was watching a chaffinch. From the
     Half-Way-House to New-Cross Turnpike, every sparrow was
     affrighted by the noise of their guns: but the rain by this time
     having completely wetted the locks, and damped the powder, they
     were obliged to charge with bayonets, and every tree bore marks
     of their prowess, to the Lion and Lamb at Lewisham, where they
     dined, got drunk, killed two hogs, and a Chinese sow, and, in the
     evening, were carried home by the Lewisham stage.</p>

     <p>"St. George's Fields, once the mart of London sportsmen, being
     now almost covered with houses, very few prentice-boy gunners
     were seen there. The birds which now inhabit that quarter, are
     many of them jail-birds, and if the new Magistrates were to sport
     their authority a little more than they do, they might bring down
     some of the most dangerous game with which a neighbourhood was
     ever infested.</p>

     <p>"Very few were the sportsmen on Blackheath, to the great joy of
     sheep and jackasses, and to the safety of stage-passengers, who
     were often endangered by the random shot of those <em>one-day</em>
     sportsmen. As to partridges, their lives were in no danger, not
     one of those sportmen out of fifty knowing the difference between
     a partridge and a crow; besides, as their dogs are generally of
     the bull-dog kind, of the terrier, or the fox breed, the game are

     known since the French Courtezan, who curled her hair with them:
     or the days of Cleopatra, who swallowed a jewel as a rich
     repast."&mdash;(<cite>Times, Aug. 22, 1799.</cite>)</p>

<p>The singular belief that used to obtain, and still is prevalent,
especially among the lower classes, that a man might sell his wife to
any bidder, provided that he did so in open market, and with a halter
round her neck, was in full force at the latter end of the 18th
Century. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page343" name="page343"></a>(p. 343)</span> That this belief has not died out may be seen in an
article on "Wife Selling," by my brother, in "All the year Round" 20th
Dec. 1884, in which he cites cases as recently as 1862, 1870,
1881&mdash;and two in 1882&mdash;in one of which, the wife was sold for a glass
of ale, and the other, for a penny and a dinner.</p>

<div class="quote">
     <p>"By some mistake, or omission, in the report of the Smithfield
     Market, we have not learned the average price of wives for the
     last week.</p>

     <p>"The increasing value of the <em>fair sex</em> is esteemed by several
     eminent writers as the certain criterion of increasing
     civilization. <span class="smcap">Smithfield</span> has, on this ground, strong pretensions
     to refined improvement, as the price of Wives has risen in that
     market from half a guinea, to three guineas and a
     half."&mdash;(<cite>Times, July 22, 1797.</cite>)</p>

     <p class="p2">"An Hostler's wife, in the country, lately fetched <em>twenty-five
     guineas</em>. We hear there is to be a sale of wives soon at
     Christie's. We have no doubt they will soon <em>go off</em>
     well."&mdash;(<cite>Times, Sept. 19, 1797.</cite>)</p>

     <p class="p2">"On Friday a butcher exposed his wife to sale in Smithfield
     Market, near the Ram Inn, with a halter about her neck, and one
     about her waist, which tied her to a railing, when a hog-driver
     was the happy purchaser, who gave the husband three guineas, and
     a crown, for his departed rib. Pity it is, there is no stop put
     to such depraved conduct in the lower order of people."&mdash;(<cite>Times,
     July 18, 1797.</cite>)</p>

     <p class="p2">"On Saturday evening last, John Lees, steel-burner, sold his wife
     for the small sum of 6<i>d.</i> to Samuel Hall, fell-monger, both of
     Sheffield. Lees gave Hall one guinea immediately, to have her
     taken off to Manchester the day following by the coach: she was
     delivered up with a halter round her neck, and the clerk of the
     market received 4<i>d.</i> for toll. It would be well if some law was
     inforced to put a stop to such degrading traffic!! (Sheffield
     Register)"&mdash;(<cite>Times, March 30, 1796.</cite>)</p>

     <p class="p2"><span class="pagenum"><a id="page344" name="page344"></a>(p. 344)</span> "At the last sale of wives there was but a poor show
     though there were plenty of bidders. One alone went off well,
     being bought by a Taylor, who outbid eight of his
     competitors."&mdash;(<cite>Times, Dec. 2, 1797.</cite>)</p>

     <p class="p2">Advt. "<span class="smcap">To the Curious.</span> J. Harrison begs leave to inform his
     Friends, and the Public, that he has, for sale, a great variety
     of grafted Gooseberry Plants, in pots, with red, white, and black
     Currants growing on each, the fruit of the finest flavour: and
     handsome standard Currant Trees, 5 feet high, with red, white,
     and black, fruit on each, likewise dwarf Apple Trees, handsome
     plants, suitable for the borders of pleasure gardens, being full
     of fine fruit. Gentlemen and Ladies are invited to come and view
     his plants, now the fruits are on them, at his Nursery, opposite
     the Turks Head, half-way to Deptford Upper Road."&mdash;(<cite>Times, Aug.

     <p class="p2">"When the order for the embargo was received at Gravesend, two
     hoys, the one for Margate, the other for Ramsgate, lay off the
     town, and were immediately subjected to the restriction. One had
     nearly 200 persons on board, the other, upwards of 150; they were
     obliged to land, and the place not affording accommodation for so
     large, and unexpected, an influx of company, a whimsical scene of
     confusion, disorder, and embarrassment, ensued: some in carts,
     &amp;c., got on to Rochester, and Canterbury: but, owing to the
     march, and embarkation of troops, all the carriages, and horses,
     on the road were engaged, and several days elapsed before these
     unfortunate people reached the place of their
     destination."&mdash;(<cite>Times, Aug. 19, 1799.</cite>)</p>

     <p class="p2">"Lately died at Lynn, in her 78th year Miss Mary Breese. She
     never lived out of the parish she was born in, was a remarkable
     sportswoman, regularly took out her shooting license, kept as
     good greyhounds, and was as sure a shot, as was in the county. At
     her desire, her dogs, and her favourite mare, were killed at her
     death, and buried in one grave."&mdash;(<cite>Times, Oct. 8, 1799.</cite>)</p>

     <p class="p2">"Late on Sunday evening last a beautiful Circassian arrived at
     the Turkish Ambassador's Hotel. She was brought from <span class="pagenum"><a id="page345" name="page345"></a>(p. 345)</span>
     Smyrna in the '<i>Princess</i>,' Capt. W. Lee, as a present from the
     Grand Seignior to his Excellency the Ambassador. She is
     peculiarly elegant, and beautiful, and was escorted hither by six
     black eunuchs. The Ambassador showed great attention to Capt. Lee
     on account of the care he had taken of his mistress."&mdash;(<cite>Times,
     Dec. 19, 1799.</cite>)</p>

     <p class="p2">"The <em>fair Circassian</em> has not yet made her appearance in public.
     A very splendid equipage is now building in Long Acre for her.
     Several of our dashing young men of fashion have offered
     themselves as drivers to the Eastern beauty."&mdash;(<cite>Times, Dec. 24,
     1799.</cite>)</p>

the centre, and its circumference divided into little separate
cavities, or cells, distinguished by the letters E, and O, placed over
them alternately: the hollow circle is put in motion, and a small
ivory ball thrown upon it in a contrary direction; after several
turns, the inclination of the surface carries the ball down towards
the cavities prepared for its reception, in one of which, having
rebounded several times, it at last rests, and the parties concerned

Sir John Coventry, who, in Charles the Second's time, was favourable
to a motion, in the House of Commons, to impose a tax on play-houses,
which was opposed by the Court. Sir John Birkenhead having remarked
that the players were the King's servants, and a part of his pleasure,
Sir J. Coventry asked "Whether the King's pleasure lie among the men,
or the women, that acted?" This was neither forgotten nor forgiven,
and Sir John was set upon whilst walking home, by some ruffians. He
defended himself desperately, and wounded some of his assailants, but

easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
